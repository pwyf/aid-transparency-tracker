They must be register with the relevant registration authority. \n\n\"The purpose of the ARES web sites of the Ministry of Finance is to provide a single-point access to all data concerning economic entities kept in particular registers or maintained in files of the state administration. ARES provides an easy access to the data transferred from the source registers to the ARES database. It allows also to switch directly to www applications of the state administration bodies provided that such applications already exist.\" [1]\n\n\"It is not possible to make a registration in the Information System ARES directly. It is necessary to proceed in accordance with applicable laws and to make a registration at the registration points of the public administration authorities. Likewise, data changes or termination of the registration must be reported to the institution that maintains the source registry. List of source registers and responsible institutions is presented in the tab REGISTRATION AUTHORITIES.\" [2]\n\n Information on companies is searchable in English and is free-of-charge.\n\n[1] http://wwwinfo.mfcr.cz/ares/ares_es.html.en\n[2] http://wwwinfo.mfcr.cz/ares/ares.html.en"

        "en": "In France, companies register through a number of institutions, predominantly the local centres de formalit\u00e9s des entreprises, but all companies must eventually be registered with the Trade and Companies Register. Once registered, companies receive a SIREN or SIRET number, which is a unique business identifier.\n\nThis information is maintained by Infogreffe. Infogreffe provide a basic overview of company information for free, and bulk download of data for a fee.\n\nA note on identifiers: \n\n- A SIRET number is constituted by the SIREN number, plus the NIC code. \n\n- The SIREN number relates to a business, whereas a SIRET number relates to a specific geographically located establishment which will be owned by a business.\n\n- \"A SIREN number is your unique French business identification number. This 9 digit number will be requested by all French administration when dealing with you.. It is a proof that you are a fully registered French business\" [1]\n\n\"The SIRET code/number is an INSEE code which allows the geographic identification of any French establishment or business.\n\nThe 14-digit number consists of three parts:\n\n- first, the SIREN code of the business (or legal unit or person) that owns the unit represented by the SIRET code,\n- second, the NIC (French: Num\u00e9ro interne de classement), is a sequential four-digit number unique to the establishment,\n- and finally, a check digit that verifies the entire SIRET number.\n\nFor example, 732 829 320 00074 would refer to the seventh establishment of the business with SIREN number 732 829 320.\" [2]\n\n\"Registration is administered by local centres de formalit\u00e9s des entreprises ( CFE), which checks your application and submits details to the relevant agencies (for a small fee). The CFE will provide you with a form M0, which is for the creation of a company.\" [3] \n\n\"Creating a company requires that it is registered with the Trade and Companies Register (RCS).\" [4] \n\n\"WHAT SOURCE IS USED FOR INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE INFOGREFFE WEBSITE?\n\nInformation concerning companies entered on the Trade and Companies Register with Registries of the Commercial Courts is taken directly from public registers held by said registries. \n\nInformation concerning companies entered on the Trade and Companies Register with other jurisdictions (district courts with commercial jurisdiction, mixed commercial courts in the overseas departments and territories) is provided by the National Industrial Property Institute (INPI).\n\nInformation concerning companies not entered on the Trade and Companies Register is taken from data on the SIRENE listing held by INSEE.\" [5]\n\n\"WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE INFOGREFFE WEBSITE?\nInfogreffe makes the following information available to the general public:\n\nFree information\n\u2022    Company search and information form\n\u2022    Key figures concerning a company\n\u2022    Implementing tracking (free alert, paid consultation).\n\u2022    Lists of articles of association and company deeds available.\n\u2022    Your formalities with online help to be incorporated on the Trade and Companies Register.\n\nPaid information\nView, download, order\" [6]\n\n[1] http://www.startbusinessinfrance.com/blog/post/tip-what-is-a-siren-or-siret-number\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIRET_code\n[3] https://www.justlanded.com/english/France/France-Guide/Business/Paperwork\n[4][5] https://www.infogreffe.com/societes/formalites-entreprise/immatriculation-entreprise.html\n[6] https://www.infogreffe.com/societes/informations-et-dossiers-entreprises/aide-faq.html#1"

However, in the event a foreign organization was to carry out business activities pursuant to Article 272 of the LOCE it may remain subject to registration as in accordance with that provision.\nAfter obtaining MOFA or MOI approval to be established, a foreign or local NGO must also register with the CDC if it wishes to import duty free materials to serve its program.

For tax-exempt entities (non-profits, charities etc.) the IRS maintains a list of EINs. Public listed company EINs are available via the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \n\nOther EINs may be available by asking the organisation concerned, and are sometimes published on their websites.\n\n\"An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. Generally, businesses need an EIN. \" [1]\n\n\"An employer identification number (EIN), also called a tax ID number or taxpayer ID, is required for most business entities... A tax ID number is not required if you operate a sole proprietorship or an LLC with no employees, in which case you would simply use your own Social Security Number as a tax ID.\" [2]\n\nIn the US, corporate registration happens at the state level. The timeliness, availability, and licensing of this data varies among all 50 states. There is no federal dataset that contains all corporate registrations.\n\nAcross the states, performance varies widely and in many cases data is not available in bulk, is not machine readable, is not openly licensed etc. For more detail, see the per state summary on Open Corporates. \n\n\"The Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. When the number is used for identification rather than employment tax reporting, it is usually referred to as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and when used for the purposes of reporting employment taxes, it is usually referred to as an EIN.\" [3] \n\n[1] https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/employer-id-numbers-eins\n[2] http://tax.findlaw.com/federal-taxes/is-a-tax-id-required-for-my-business-.html\n[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employer_Identification_Number"

In the UK and Ireland, all registered businesses are automatically issued with a D-U-N-S Number [3][4].\n\nD-U-N-S Numbers are location-specific so one legal entity may have many associated D-U-N-S Numbers, one for each business location [2].\n\n[1] https://www.dnb.co.uk/duns-number.html\n[2] https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/\n[3] https://www.dnb.com/solutions/government/duns-number-request-guide.html\n[4] https://www.dnb.co.uk/duns-number/lookup/request-a-duns-number.html"

        "en": "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) maintain a list of organisations whom are involved in the transfer of 'Official Development Assistance' (ODA) financial flows. This list provides a useful fall-back source of identification for government agencies and multilateral organisations involved in aid, and in some cases, for international NGOs. \n\nThe list is updated perioidically in response to demand for new entries from DAC members. \n\nUsers should note that this list is designed to identify both organisations *and* funds or programmes, and so not all entries in this list equate to legally registered organisations. \n\nThe list is available as a spreadsheet containing multiple codelists. Two can be used to construct organisation identifiers.\n\n* The **Agency** list is used to construct identifiers for aid donor and recipient government agencies. This is constructed by combining the **donorcode** and **AgencyCode**, separated with a dash. For example, XM-DAC-1-8 identifies the Austrian (1) Development Agency (8).\n \n* The **Channel codes** list is used to construct identifiers for multilateral organisations, and international NGOs for whom no other identifier is available. The 'Channel ID' should be used. For example, XM-DAC-41301 is the identifier for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). \n\n* The **Donor** list contains donor code values referring to the donor country as a whole. To maximise consistency, donor codes should not be used unless a specific agency, government department or fund is not identified for the reporting. In all other cases codes should be published in their 'Agency' form (e.g. XM-DAC-1-8 for Austrian Development Agency, rather than XM-DAC-1). \n\nUsers should also note that some organisations exist in both the 'Channel Codes' and 'Agency' lists. As the Channel Codes list provides a cross-walk, use of the Channel Codes is preferred in these cases."
