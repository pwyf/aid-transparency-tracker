Over the past three years, the fund has dedicated more than US$ 190 million to increase climate resilience in 28 countries around the world.\n \n  Climate change is increasing the burdens of the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. \n \n  Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives\n",

It has a high reputation for the effectiveness of its work, and the significance of its impact through important international networks which actively contribute to the global tax agenda.\nATAF work directly focuses on 2 key areas: technical assistance and research which inform its broader representative role.\nSpecifically, ATAF offers technical support and advisory services to Revenue Authorities through country-based programmes on domestic and international taxes and tax systems including audit, and administrative structures, and domestic and international tax policy, exchange of information. It also carries out capacity building training.  ATAF also has an important research arm which has developed vehicles such as the African Tax Outlook, the African Research Network and the Executive master’s degree on Taxation.

The mission of the Agência do Zambeze, which was established in 2010, is to promote the socio-economic and sustainable development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. This Basin comprises 34 districts in four provinces: Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezi. In addition to these districts the Agency’s geographical remit also comprise 6 districts that fall outside the River Basin area. \n\nFollowing Decree No. 23/2010 of June 2010 the ZVDA is mandated to act in three areas:\n\n•\tUndertake studies and present strategies for the socio-economic development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. \n•\tProvide technical and financial assistance to socio-economic development initiatives in the Lower Zambezi River Basin, including mobilizing funds for such initiatives and channelling them to beneficiaries. \n•\tProvide support to local governments in local land use planning and socio-economic development\n\nThe management of the Agency has taken the strategic decision to facilitate, rather than to implement development projects. By means of national and international tenders, public and private partners are invited to apply to undertake the projects. To a limited extent, ZVDA staff or consultants are charged with project management tasks.\n\nThe Agency seeks to play a decisive role in coordinating the relationship between the partners, funders, implementing agencies and beneficiaries. Therefore, information collection and sharing, supervision and monitoring of projects and programmes are key tasks.\n",

    "description": "AVSI has been present in South Sudan since 1992 and in 2005 opened its first permanent base in the state of Eastern Equatoria. In recent years AVSI has gained deep experience in the fields of education, agriculture and food security. In the state of the Lakes, AVSI has been implementing food security projects since 2011 with particular attention to issues related to security and peacebuilding, components that have an important influence on the success of activities and on the general improvement of the context in which it operates. In Eastern Equatoria AVSI is one of the most operational organizations in the field of education; UNICEF&#039;s main partner, AVSI staff deals with projects that support the educational apparatus both from a structural point of view and from the point of view of teacher training and community awareness, one of the strengths of the organization. In addition, also in Eastern Equatoria, AVSI has now acquired a primary position also in the field of food security and agricultural development, supporting the most vulnerable families with emergency distributions while investing in local farmers with a view to strengthening the resilience and self-sufficiency of local communities. Although there is a particular focus on these two sectors, AVSI works for the holistic development of the person and his community, engaging in a multi-sectoral approach that has allowed the staff to acquire specific professional skills also in the field of nutrition, water and protection; these elements are always considered in the planning and implementation of project actions in such a way as to create synergies between different projects and create sustainability. Over the years, AVSI has built and strengthened links both with the local population – through village chiefs and traditional local authorities – and with institutional figures at the state and county levels. A constant and open dialogue with the beneficiaries of the projects has allowed AVSI to build, together with local actors, tailor-made solutions that respond in a particular way to the needs of the population, as demonstrated by the results produced by the emergency and resilience strengthening projects implemented in partnership with FAO (ERLP).",

    "description": "With the support of local people and civil society organization, the movement against the bonded labour kicked off 1995 from Geta VDC of Kalali district- a far western district of Nepal. Five years after the struggle, the bonded labor system was officially abolished in Nepal following the government committed to rehabilitate and provide them compensation in terms of land, creation of employment opportunity and education for their children. This was a huge achievements for the ex bonded labour who were deprived of their rights and entitlements under various alibis for ages. Unfortunately, the lack of effective implementation of the commitment has remained a major challenge and as a result the great majority of ex bonded labour continue to suffer with no sign of relenting. Hence, the project jointly has implemented by the BASE as lead applicant and WVAF as partner organization have envisioned ameliorating the situation that has remained a long overdue. Moreover, the project will also contribute in achieving some of the goals of MDG by addressing the problem of ex-Kamaiya related with child labour and unemployment/underemployment through livelihood support, education, holding duty bearers to account and capacity building of Kamaiya leaders. It is implemented in five districts of Nepal.",

    "description": "Systeemverandering voor duurzame en rechtvaardige samenlevingen is het 7de gemeenschappelijke programma van Broederlijk Delen en Studio Globo.\n\nOp lange termijn streven we naar duurzame en rechtvaardige samenlevingen waar iedereen goed leeft met genoeg en er rekening wordt gehouden met de grenzen van onze planeet. Omdat er meer nodig is dan verfraaiingswerk, wordt systeemverandering de rode draad in onze strategie, met sociale en ecologische rechtvaardigheid als transversaal principe, toegepast op 3 domeinen van verandering: grondstoffen en voedselsystemen, wereldwijde solidariteit in beweging en politieke stem en participatie.\n\nVerandering is mogelijk als mensen samen kiezen voor inclusie en participatie. Daarom verbinden we gemeenschappen in Vlaanderen en de partnerlanden in een wereldwijde solidaire beweging met een positief en sterk ethisch verhaal van delen en herverdelen. Zo komen we tot een internationale samenwerking die ‘Noord en Zuid’ als tegenstelling achter zich laat. Weliswaar niet blind voor de ongelijke verdeling van de nefaste gevolgen van onrechtvaardige machtsstructuren. Daarom is er specifieke aandacht voor wie hard getroffen wordt. De realiteit is dat dit hoofdzakelijk in de partnerlanden is.\n\nPolitiek werk staat voorop om het beleid te veranderen, zowel in de partnerlanden als in België. Daarvoor is een draagvlak nodig. Verandering groeit vanaf de basis. Via ons brede netwerk sensibiliseren en mobiliseren we de Vlaamse samenleving voor internationale solidariteit. Met bewegingswerk en educatie stimuleren we kritische analyse, sociale actie en structurele verandering. Creatieve modellen, de kracht van ontmoetingen, vormingstrajecten en pittige debatten prikkelen van jongs af tot verbondenheid in het perspectief van meer solidariteit. We komen in zo’n 60% van de Vlaamse scholen en werken actiegericht met duizenden vrijwilligers in ruim 1500 lokale groepen en met partnerorganisaties in 11 landen. Vijf jaar samen wereldwijde beweging maken moet meer dan een radertje van het systeem anders doen draaien.",

Operating nationwide, it strives to promote equitable and sustainable development, humanitarian response, and other relevant interventions aimed at improving the quality of life and wellbeing of communities and individuals. The organization&#039;s approach is two-pronged and innovative. On one hand, BFD carries out multi-sectoral emergency response projects to address immediate humanitarian needs in nutrition, health, WASH, education, shelter, CCCM, protection, food security & livelihoods, and EECR sectors. On the other hand, it focuses on developmental empowerment and capacity building of local actors, underscoring the importance of transitioning swiftly from rapid response to resilience-building methods. This approach is crucial for communities to recover, rise again, and harness their capacities, starting with fostering peace through innovative measures.\n\nBFD&#039;s programs, spanning various sectors like food security and livelihoods, nutrition and health, WASH, clean energy and environment, protection, education and child rights, shelter/NFI and camp management, economic empowerment, governance, and peace-building, operate in different geographies based on strategic and donor humanitarian response plans. The organization is a trusted partner of a wide array of UN agencies and donors, participating actively in national sectoral groups and international forums like Sphere, ICVA, CHS Alliance, and more.\nCertified against the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS) since 2023, BFD&#039;s alignment with the 2030 SDGs and Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan 2021 underlines its commitment to poverty alleviation and sustainable development in Yemeni society.

    "description": "CEHRD was incorporated in August 15, 1999 as the Niger Delta Project for Environment, Human Rights and Development (NDPEHRD) and re-incorporated under its new name CEHRD in 2005 following its board decision. CEHRD was founded by conservationists, environmentalists, activists, and health workers in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. CEHRD was formed to respond to the environmental, human rights, rural health, and underdevelopment problems plaguing the Niger Delta.\n\nCEHRD’s scope is local and national in nature. While we liaise with international groups by way of networks and coalitions, our primary focus remains improving on peoples’ traditional knowledge of biodiversity conservation, monitoring, documenting and reporting of human rights violations, and advocating for justice, particularly in the Niger Delta region.\n\n1. Our works cut across all strata of society in terms of age, gender and abilities.\n\n2. The ratio of women to men we serve is 55:45.      \n\nCEHRD’s work spans through the entire Niger Delta. Our main focus is on the rural areas, its people, biodiversity conservation, rural health and population. We also monitor document and report human rights violations across the region. In some of the cases, CEHRD provides legal advocacy to victims of human rights violations. With an unemployment rate of over 70%, dire poverty, and dim prospects, some young men seek financial and physical security by joining armed gangs, or &quot;cults.&quot;  Many of these cults are periodically sponsored by local government officials and/or community leaders to carry out campaigns of violence designed to influence local decision-making, especially during election periods. Often, these gangs are also used to sway village leaders and communities&#039; opinions on oil-related projects.  In all cases, the influx of cheap arms has led to a drastic increase in violence.  ",

Today, the CISP is active in more than 30 countries with initiatives for the affirmation of fundamental rights and social inclusion, the fight against inequalities and social injustice, the creation of economic and social opportunities as well as the protection of marginalised people.\nWe have achieved important goals, the most crucial of which is to have supported millions of people in their pursuit of self-determination. Women, children, elderly, men and communities that do not give in to marginality, violence, food insecurity and a lack of rights. Together with these people, their communities, associations, local authorities and institutions, we have built schools and trained teachers, innovated education systems, strengthened food security through diversification of income sources and micro-credit and improved agricultural production by small-scale producers. We have also contributed to the definition and implementation of public policies so that they take into account the needs and rights of the least protected sections of the population, promoted laws to protect the weakest and brought drinking water to places where there had never been any.\nIn 2018, we updated our Declaration of Intent - Rights, Change, Sustainability - incorporating all the strategic guidelines of the 2030 Agenda as well as each of its Sustainable Development Goals. There are two basic guidelines of the 2030 Agenda on which we are focusing in practice: the need to address sustainability in all its dimensions (environment, society, economy, institutions) and the need to combat poverty and social exclusion as interdependent objectives.\n",

We understand &quot;durable solutions&quot; as any means by which the situation of refugees can be permanently and satisfactorily resolved, enabling them to live normal lives. Durable solutions can be voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement. In Denmark, DRC assists refugees in all aspects of integration as well as asylum procedures. Internationally, DRC actively participates in supporting the protection of refugees, and promoting durable solutions for conflict-affected populations.\n\nThe DRC’s supreme authority is the Council, which consists of up to three representatives of each member organisation, six representatives of the voluntary groups and refugee counselling organisations cooperating with the Danish Refugee Council, and of the Executive Committee.\nDRC is an umbrella organisation and is currently consisting of 30 organisation members and voluntary groups, committed to the refugee cause. Membership of the DRC is open to non-party-political, voluntary, nationwide humanitarian and international organisations that work on a democratic basis, and whose aims conform to those of the DRC.\n\nProviding refugees, internally displaced persons and other affected groups in situations of war and conflict with assistance according to their rights. This assistance can consist of relief and other humanitarian aid, rehabilitation and support to return home, as well as contributions to the promotion of durable solutions\nContributing to capacity building and co-operation between local and national authorities, as well as other relevant organisations. This work aims at strengthening advocacy and promoting solutions to problems related to situations of conflict, particularly with a view to improving the protection and reintegration of refugees and internally displaced persons\nUnder its mandate, DRC International focuses on protection, relief, rehabilitation, post-conflict recovery, capacity-building, humanitarian mine-action, and advocacy.

However, DRC also implements through local partners when this is the best way to meet DRC’s mandate and values. In such cases, DRC is committed to assist the implementing partner strengthen its accountability and capacity.\n\nDRC International’s activities are funded by money raised from the Danish public and by project grants from the Danish government and other bilateral governmental donors, the European Union, and the United Nations.

We use a repeatable model to: \n•\ttrain educators in the importance of play-based teaching for children’s learning \n•\ttrain communities and parents in the importance of play for children’s development\n•\twork with communities to design and install high-quality, sustainable and child-centred playgrounds.\n\nWe have expanded our work to refugee settlements, successfully completing projects in partnership with  UNICEF, Plan International, Save the Children, World Vision and other major NGOs, and have advised the Ugandan Government’s Ministry of Education and Sports on their Early Years and Outdoor Spaces policies. We also support disadvantaged young people to gain skills and employment through our apprenticeship and employment programmes. We have recently been awarded The Foundation for Social Improvement’s Small Charity, Big Impact award for our impact and our monitoring and evaluation work. We have recently built our 350th playground, and with each of our playgrounds benefitting an average of 1,500 children, our work has made a difference to the lives of half a million children in Uganda over the last 10 years, helping them gain all the benefits of play. We’ve also provided employment and training for 60 Ugandan staff since our inception, including 12 former street children, through our apprenticeship and employability programmes.   \n",

Partners for Good (PfG) aims at supporting communities to realize a brighter future through positive development, empowerment, and partnerships. PfG’ Mission is “Supporting communities to realize a brighter future through positive development, empowerment, and partnerships”. PfG envisions: “A world where people own an opportunity to live and prosper with dignity”. Partners for Good bears its roots to an accumulative 20 years of experience of Global Communities’ successful youth, good governance and community empowerment programs in Jordan. Global Communities sought a viable way to carry forward in Jordan the learning and methodologies that have been the foundations of its successful programs in child labor, good governance, youth empowerment and workforce development, entrepreneurship and innovation. Based on these goals, Global Communities founded Partners for Good. Partners for Good, carried on with the robust body of work developed by Global Communities, and innovated its own ideas, approaches and interventions to support various aspects concentrated for youth empowerment and development in Jordan. This manifested in planning and implementing various research, data collection, youth engagement, youth-led initiatives and programs which Partners for Good either led or participated in. The core and strategic interventions led by PfG focused on: positive youth development and civic engagement, youth entrepreneurship support and youth employ-ability. ",

Identifying that food is the best medicine, they believed that developing small-scale agriculture is the key to reducing rural poverty. In 1987, Farm Africa started work with nomadic pastoralists in the remote north of Kenya, expanding to Ethiopia a year later.  \n\nFarm Africa believes that Africa has the power to feed itself and that its smallholders hold the key to lasting rural prosperity. We work directly with farmers to help them unleash their potential to feed Africa’s people.  We pioneer techniques that boost harvests, reduce poverty, sustain natural resources and help end Africa’s need for aid.  \n\nFarm Africa has 200 staff operating across the east African countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.  Farm Africa’s local staff provide the tools and expertise to enable smallholders in eastern Africa to increase their harvests, whether they farm crops, livestock, fish or the forest.  We train them to be more commercial, adding value to surpluses by milling, drying, or turning their produce into products that fetch a higher price.  With better food for their families and reliable incomes from their businesses, farmers can build for the future.\n\n\n\n\n",

FOWODE was established, to pursue the vision of a Ugandan society where women and men equally participate in and benefit from decision making processes in public and private spaces. Whereas FOWODE primarily focuses on women’s issues, she also seeks gender equality and thus involves men in all aspects of her work. With operations at the community, local government and national levels, FOWODE champions women’s rights through capacity development, community empowerment, policy engagement and strategic partnerships.

    "description": "The FMS was created in 2007 to promote women&#039;s rights through the investment in women-led organisations. The FMS is the only women’s fund of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay that led women’s groups and movements working to achieve long– term social change. The FMS´s missionis to mobilize financial and technical resources and strengthen organisational capacities of women&#039;s organisations in situation of most socio-economic, cultural and environmental disadvantages in Latin America and the Southern Cone, which aim to advance gender equality as the path for a just and equitable social change.\n\nThe FMS supports women’s groups and organisations and women right’s defenders to advance women’s rights and gender equality in Latin America, with focus on the southern cone sub region. It has two key mandates (i) mobilizing international and local resources and grantmaking towards women’s rights work; (ii) building social movement with capacity development towards social change. \n\nThe FMS mobilizes resources to support women’s rights groups and organisations through direct and flexible grants from an equal and transparent partnership, based on the conviction that women have enormous potential to be agents of social change. We believe that if women and their organisations are empowered to defend their rights and access to equal opportunities to fulfill their potential, we will contribute with inclusive, participative and sustainable models of development and wellbeing at the community level. \n\nTo ensure the realization of its mission, the FMS focuses on:  \n\n-Empowering women’s of most disadvantaged groups decision making and political agency by both strengthening their organizing and advocacy skills and supporting the development of inclusive and democratic leaderships, respectful of diversity and multiculturality and with regional and subregional-wide visions.\n\n- Supporting exclusively groups and organisations led and composed by women of the most disadvantaged groups in societies and fund controversial and traditionally marginalized and invisibilized issues at the community level; such as labour rights of women workers from precarious sectors like domestic and sewing workers; environmental rights of indigenous women’s rights defenders; criminalization of women’s human rights defenders and activists; LGTTTBI, among others.\n\n-Influencing community philanthropy and development aid sectors to increase the resources available for women’s human rights initiatives. The ultimate goal is to impact the culture of philanthropy in Latin America from a sustainable, participatory and inclusive development approach with focus on raising awareness about women’s human rights; thus changing the social landscape. \n\n",

The tools use the methodology of learning-by-doing, empowering people living with HIV with knowledge and skills and building the capacity of our partners.\nUsing the power of evidence-based advocacy we can improve the HIV response and the lives of people living with HIV. In different countries the tools have been instrumental to policy change. For example, in Malawi the results of the PLHIV Stigma Index has lead to a new first-line antiretroviral treatment.\n\nGNP+ provides technical assistance to networks using our tools, and we often use the data gathered by the national networks in international advocacy, showcasing the challenges and issues of people living with HIV around the world.",

GoodWeave brings visibility to global supply chains, gives voice to informal and marginalized workers, provides assurance that certified products are free of child labor, and restores childhood to vulnerable children so they can laugh, learn, and play.  Over 25 years of pioneering and innovating a system that at the core harnesses market power through its work with brands and producers, GoodWeave has rescued over 6,700 children from labor, provided quality education to almost 26,000 rescued and vulnerable children, and deterred hundreds of thousands of children from entering labor.  Most recently, GoodWeave has expanded into apparel, home textiles, fashion jewelry, bricks, and tea where its reach and impact continue to grow.  GoodWeave’s impact goes beyond reach numbers as it has been a leading voice in positively influencing societal norms and behaviors to eliminate child labor.",

We also capture the perspective of field staff and local partner organisations as a counterpoint to the views of those caught up in humanitarian crises.\nWe believe that the intended beneficiaries of humanitarian aid should have more of a say in how aid is provided. Through our work, we help them communicate their feedback to policymakers and aid providers in the most effective way possible. We regularly engage with people affected by crisis to discover whether they find humanitarian services relevant and fair, if they trust aid agencies, and whether they feel empowered. Our goal is to make their perceptions the touchstone and driver of humanitarian effectiveness. To achieve this, we champion the views of people affected by crisis at the global level and wherever decisions about aid are made.",

    "description": "As Jordan strives to take its place as a modern country on the world map, education takes an even greater role in raising the future generation. A country with few natural resources, Jordan looks to its human resources as the key element for its success in the markets of the region, and the prosperity, health, and security of its people. Despite the very high enrolment rates and the availability of access to schools across the Kingdom, the quality of education remains uneven. The average achievement in urban areas is higher than that in the rural and more remote areas. One of the major challenges of the Ministry of Education is to provide the schools with the required budget to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum learning in all schools across the Kingdom. The schools in remote areas lack sufficient electricity to operate daily services such as providing efficient heating and cooling systems within the classrooms lighting the classrooms, connecting computers and online learning, in extreme temperatures and lack of sufficient financial resources to improve the schools’ environment. A further challenge is, the large influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan, since 2011 has increased the load on the Kingdom’s already limited resources. Key drivers of tension between the hosting communities and the refugees at the micro-level are safeguarding livelihoods and competition for income-generating opportunities; the struggle to find adequate, affordable housing; and challenges in the education sector such as difficulty in accessing education and a deteriorating learning environment. The Syrian crisis has exacerbated long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, demand and management. Securing a sustainable energy pathway for Jordan is more critical today than ever. As per the latest statistics, electricity consumption in the northern governorates (those mostly affected by the Syrian crisis) showed an additional increase of 2.3 per cent compared to other governorates in Jordan. \n\nThis project aims to contribute to the overall efforts aiming at mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in line with the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) focusing on the Northern governorates (Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid, and North of Balqa’a Governorates) that are most affected by the Syrian crisis. This will be achieved through the use of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems to reduce the growing energy demands improve the learning environment in schools, increase enrollment and retention of Jordanian and Syrian students, improving the livelihood of surrounding communities and promote the social cohesion at the same time. \n\nProviding the schools with innovative techniques to reduce expenditure in energy bills and generate income will greatly relieve the ministry of the financial burden as well as allowing students, regardless of geographic location and nationality access to a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum academic achievement.\n\nHorizons is a partner organization alongside Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities (FPEC) and Princess Alia Foundation (PAF).

    "description": "Vi Agroforestry is a Swedish development organisation fighting poverty and climate change together. What started as a tree planting initiative in 1983, is today an agroforestry expert organisation working through local partnerships to run holistic agricultural development projects in East Africa and beyond. Since 1983, we have contributed to the planting of about 160 million trees.\n\nWe work in collaboration with farmer’s organisations, advising and training farmers in sustainable agricultural land management such as agroforestry. In agroforestry, trees are planted alongside crops and livestock on the farmland. This gives more fertile soils, better yields, and a richer variety of crops. Farmers shifting to agroforestry get more food and better incomes. The trees also help increase biodiversity, bind carbon, and stop soil from being washed away by floods.\n\nOver the last ten years, we have helped more than 2.4 million improve their livelihoods. We offer outstanding expertise in agroforestry, climate change adaptation and mitigation, promoting well-proven practices based on scientific research. Our focus on both human and environmental sustainability makes us unique.\n\nWe are presently working in three East African countries: Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. We focus on where we are most relevant and can make a difference – both in terms of which countries to work in and what areas in the countries. The selection is based on criteria such as an area’s vulnerability to climate change, the value we can contribute, and resources available.\n\nIn the coming years, we will look into expanding our geographical area, both within the current countries in East Africa, and into new countries. Special attention will be given to exploring arid and semi-arid areas where agroforestry has great potential to make unproductive lands fertile.",

    "description": "The Institute for Integrated Development Studies (IIDS) is an independent, non-partisan, and not-for-profit think-tank headquartered in Kathmandu, Nepal. Since its inception in 1979, it has proven its commitment to research and policy advocacy based on evidence and a holistic approach to sustainable development.\n\nLeading up to 2030, the vision of IIDS is to build on its storied legacy of over 40 years to reorient and consolidate policy priorities across Nepal and South Asia. Its goal is to seek greater development impact through research, advocacy and incubation of innovation. It seeks to be one of the region’s leading institutes that contributes to evidence-based policymaking; trains professionals; and broadens public understanding of sustainable development challenges and solutions in the 21st century.\n\nIIDS is overseen by a Governing Council comprising of former ministers, policymakers, administrators, and scholars. There are more than 25 research, program and administrative staff, led by an Executive Director. IIDS has more than 12 distinguished fellows, senior fellows, and adjunct fellows. It also has a pool of over one hundred consultants. The executives of the organization are recognized in the region for their expertise. Likewise, the core staff have several years of experiences in designing and conducting large scale research activities and implementing projects. IIDS is also experienced in organizing flagship policy conferences and seminars.\n\nIIDS currently houses the Secretariat of the South Asia Network of Economic Research Institutes (SANEI) with 59 member institutions. It is a member of the Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration (EROPA), as well as the South Asian Centre for Policy Studies (SACEPS). IIDS has also hosted international offices in the past, such as the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).\n\nOver the past 40 years, the impact of IIDS has been extensive through dozens of projects and hundreds of knowledge products shared across society to influence reasoned policymaking and make development effective. Its studies and surveys have spanned macro-economics, public finance, education, agriculture and rural development, food and nutrition, population and health, trade, energy, regional co-operation, women and development, poverty alleviation, conflict resolution and sustainable peace. IIDS also hosts a distinguished lecture series by inviting international scholars and policymakers of renown.\n\nIIDS works with the Government of Nepal, international organizations like the United Nations, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and a large number of bilateral development partners as well as think-tanks and NGOs. In 2016, IIDS signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Kathmandu University to, among others, launch Nepal’s first graduate program in public policy, the Master in Public Policy and Management (MPPM). IIDS has also started a series of short, non-degree executive courses in partnership with Tribhuvan University. The goal of these courses is to provide students and practitioners with cutting edge policy knowledge in a cost-effective manner.",

Investments in grantee overhead go to strengthening enduring local institutions and ensuring the sustainability of IAF grants. Organizational strengthening over the course of IAF grantmaking is a key strategy that has led to organizations still thriving twenty and thirty years after they graduate from IAF funding. The IAF works with organizations to expand their income-generating and fundraising capacities, strengthen their board structures, and improve their financial systems. Grantees also leverage additional funding and in-kind resources to co-invest in their own projects, more than doubling the U.S. investment (as of FY 2025, committing $1.37 for every $1 in IAF investment in their projects, increasing community ownership, self-reliance, and project sustainability over time).",

We develop vaccines and antibodies in and for the developing world and seek to accelerate their introduction in low-income countries.\n\nIAVI programs and partnerships are grounded in the regions of the world where the disease burden is the greatest, and our approach emphasizes sustainability. Our network of clinical research center partners in Africa and India helps strengthen in-country research capacity and supports the training and education of the next generation of scientists. The global impact of our science includes fundamental contributions to understanding the biology of HIV infection, which IAVI and others are applying toward advancing vaccine science and immunology.\n\nIAVI accelerates scientific discovery and development by fostering unique collaborations among academia, industry, local communities, governments, and funders to explore new and better ways to address public health threats that disproportionately affect people living in poverty.\n\nOur global reach, including a clinical research network in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in India, has allowed us to make fundamental contributions to understanding the epidemiology, transmission, virology, and immunology of HIV. This work played a key role in facilitating the design of promising HIV vaccine candidates, as well as the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies that are now being advanced as promising approaches for HIV prevention. Our integrated capabilities in vaccine and antibody discovery, development, and clinical research take advantage of biopharmaceutical industry expertise to accelerate the development and testing of prevention methods for HIV and other diseases. Through the Product Development Center, we support external researchers with technical and scientific expertise to accelerate the development of their own products.",

We work across society and borders to challenge the causes and address the consequences of massive human rights violations. We affirm victims’ dignity, fight impunity, and promote responsive institutions to lay the foundations for peace, justice and inclusion. \n\nThroughout its 17-year history, ICTJ provided intense advice assistance to support truth seeking processes, including truth commissions in Timor-Leste, Peru, and Sierra Leone; provided time-critical support to criminal justice efforts in Guatemala and Argentina; led efforts to ensure victims played a role in policy deliberations in Uganda, Morocco, and Iraq; and devised a massive mapping exercises of human rights violations in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Lebanon. More recently, ICTJ made vital contributions to the Colombian peace process, working to introduce an integrated transitional justice approach to key stakeholders that is reflected in the peace accords. ICTJ continues to play a trusted role in implementing the accords. In Tunisia, ICTJ supported the national consultation process, the drafting of the transitional justice law, and the establishment and capacity of the Truth and Dignity Commission. ICTJ’s work alongside activists in northern Uganda to help end stigma against children born of wartime rape and their mothers has resulted in a significant shift in attitudes in communities and pledges of support from international donors.\n\nAs an organization that simultaneously works directly in the field, conducts research, and informs thinking at the global policy level, we leverage our experience working in over 50 countries to articulate lessons learned, identify emerging patterns and develop innovative approaches.

    "description": "icddr,b – Organizational profile\n\nHistory:\n\nicddr,b was established in Dhaka in 1960s as the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) Cholera Research Laboratory. The Cholera Research Laboratory (CRL) soon developed an international reputation in diarrhoeal disease research. Among its notable early achievements was a key role in the development, testing and implementation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) – a treatment estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the CRL also established a large-scale health and demographic surveillance site at Matlab – now the longest-running such site in the global South and an inspiration for many similar sites worldwide. In 1962, the CRL established the Dhaka Hospital, still run by icddr,b, to meet the urgent need to treat patients, particularly young children, with severe diarrhoeal disease. The Dhaka Hospital has developed into a nationally important treatment centre and provides an infrastructure for an extensive programme of clinical research. Clinical services were also introduced at Matlab Hospital.\n\nAs many other factors affect the risk of diarrhoeal diseases or recovery from them – including nutritional status, income, education of mothers, access to clean water, sanitation habits and efficacy of vaccines – research at CRL expanded into new areas of public health. However, it retained its primary focus on evidence-based solutions able to deliver significant public health benefits at low cost to those living in poverty. \n\nFrom CRL to icddr,b\n\nIn 1978, the CRL received fresh impetus and a new name – the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. In recent years, we have been known simply as icddr,b.\n\nOur research continued to expand, to address the major public health threats facing Bangladesh and other countries of the global South. Extensive research programmes were implemented in areas such as malnutrition, respiratory disease, vaccine testing, maternal, neonatal and child health, and health systems. We have maintained a strong and productive relationship with the Government of Bangladesh, and played an influential role in informing and evaluating national health policies and practice.\n\nicddr,b is recognised as a national asset, and has contributed to the significant improvements in health achieved by Bangladesh in recent decades, despite the challenges posed by limited resources. In 2001, we received the first Gates Award for Global Health in recognition of our development of ORS. In 2005, we received the Independence Day Award, Bangladesh’s most prestigious national award.\n\nWe have also been committed to sharing our expertise, for example through an extensive training programme used by thousands of public health professionals, researchers and others from Bangladesh and other countries of the global South. \n\nIn addition, our researchers and clinicians have played major roles in international responses to global humanitarian crises, particularly to prevent and control outbreaks of infectious disease. Over the past 30 years, our staff have supported multiple relief efforts across Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nLooking forward, our goal is to continue generating the evidence to underpin further improvements in public health in Bangladesh, while also ensuring that our research benefits those living in other countries of the global South.\n\n\n\nicddr,b’s Strategic goals:\n\nGoal One: Maintain a Focused Research Strategy\nGoal Two: Develop and Promote Use of Innovations for Bangladesh and the global South\nGoal Three: Clinical and Humanitarian Services and Response\nGoal Four: Invest in our Research Platforms and Field Sites\nGoal Five: Increase the Visibility and Impact of Our Research Evidence\nGoal Six: Invest in Our People\nGoal Seven: Improve Organisational Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness\nGoal Eight: Ensure Financial Sustainability\n\n\nicddr,b’s Research area:\n1.\tReducing maternal, neonatal, and child mortality and improving the well-being of women and children\n2.\tPreventing and treating maternal and childhood malnutrition\n3.\tControlling enteric and respiratory Infections\n4.\tDetecting and controlling emerging and re-emerging infections\n5.\tAchieving universal health coverage\n6.\tAchieving gender equality, and sexual and reproductive health and rights\n7.\tExamining the health consequences and adaptations to climate change\n8.\tPreventing and treating non-communicable diseases\n\nicddr,b Governance structure\n\nicddr,b is led by an experienced management team, and benefits from input from internationally recognised experts in global health and international health research.\n\nThe Board of Trustees is icddr,b’s governing body and provides strategic oversight. icddr,b’s Board of Trustees comprises 17 health professionals and researchers representing both developed and developing countries. The Board was created by an Ordinance of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Three members are nominated by the People’s Republic of the Government of Bangladesh, with the World Health Organization and UNICEF nominating one member each. icddr,b’s Executive Director serves as the Member-Secretary. The Board operates under the icddr,b Ordinance and follows the Rules of Procedure. The Board of Trustees’ roles and responsibilities include fund oversight; approving and monitoring the budget; setting broad institution-wide policies, as well as monitoring adherence to the Strategic Plan; employing, evaluating and supporting the Executive Director; maintaining the line between governance and management; and evaluating the Board’s own performance. \n\nThe Senior Leadership Team (SLT), led by the Executive Director, is responsible for icddr,b’s day-to-day activities and implementing its institutional strategy. The SLT also includes the Deputy Executive Director, the Senior Directors of the Scientific Divisions, and Directors of Finance and Human Resources. In addition, it has specific departments like Regulatory and Legal Affairs, Supply Chain and Facilities Management, Communications, Information Technology, Research Administration and Technical Training Unit to  support research. The Research Administration Unit provides technical assistance for preparation and management of research proposals and monitors the human subjects review process through the Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n\nThe international Scientific Advisory Group provides scientific advice to icddr,b’s Executive Director. The purpose of the SAG is to: build capacity in the training and mentorship of young scientists on their career pathways; increase the involvement of international scientists on site at icddr,b; increase partnership opportunities with other world-class organisations; increase icddr,b’s ability to undertake research outside of Bangladesh, and align icddr,b’s research focus with our research priorities.\n\nAs a research institution, icddr,b has always been committed to strong monitoring and impact evaluation. Through ongoing use and development of the log frame used for reporting to our core donors, icddr,b systematically tracks how funds are administered and the impact of research through measurable results. Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of our currently expired Strategic Plan fell under the scope of one of its Goals and it resulted in (1) developing—and ensuring adherence to—a detailed, time-bound implementation plan, and (2) developing a revised set of indicators acceptable to our Core Donors and Board of Trustees to ensure that the plan delivered the anticipated results. icddr,b has a very strong Internal Oversight (IO) office in order to detect fraud and prevent its occurrence. Vigorous internal audit reviews deters financial impropriety and ensure value for money. The institution faces more than 30 project audits every year on top of its annual institutional audit.   taken. The Senior Leadership Team (SLT) of icddr,b provides oversight and is accountable to the Board of Trustees. Furthermore, an annual review commissioned by the Core Donor Group provides an independent assessment of our performance and complements our own monitoring and evaluation.\n\nThe Institutional Governance Framework (IGF) of icddr,b outlines the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct expected of staff members and the Code promote among others, human rights and culture of safety. Additionally, icddr,b has formulated a number of policies for Human resource, Supply Chain management, Finance, Scientific and research, gender equity, prevention of sexual harassment and child protection and Information Technology. \n\nicddr,b’s Institutional Capacity Statement:\n\nicddr,b is an autonomous non-profit, international health research organization, located in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, dedicated to improving the lives of people living in poverty in its host country Bangladesh and globally. Through the generation of knowledge, and translation of research into treatment, training and policy advocacy, icddr,b addresses some of the most critical health concerns facing the world today. \n\n•\tResearch: \nEstablished in 1960, icddr,b has developed and delivered low-cost, scalable solutions to major public health problems— such as oral rehydration solution (ORS), zinc for diarrhoeal treatment, tetanus vaccines for new born and new born care, which saved and continue to save millions of lives globally. icddr,b developed an innovative method for managing severe acute malnutrition in children, which reduced death rates by nearly half. Results were published in the Lancet, and the standardised protocol is now endorsed by the WHO throughout the region. icddr,b has rigorously tested the efficacy of many new vaccines for diseases that affect the poor – including rotavirus vaccines, the Hib vaccine, a maternal pneumonia vaccine for protecting infants, and an affordable oral cholera vaccine. Results have helped to shape Bangladesh’s Extended Programme on Immunisation and provided evidence to support vaccine use in other resource-poor settings. The innovative use of female community health workers at Matlab in the 1970s greatly increased contraceptive use and reduced fertility. The work was highly influential nationally, leading to a national programme of family welfare assistants providing family planning support, and internationally. icddr,b has maintained a long-running programme of research on violence against women. Our research and advocacy activities have had major impact, raising awareness of domestic violence, leading to changes in Bangladesh law and introduction of interventions to reduce violence against women.\n\nFew major practical innovations made by icddr,b’s researchers in recent times are ultra-low cost Bubble CPAP device to deliver oxygen to young children with severe pneumonia, the Urban Health Atlas (a GIS-based online tool), a range of affordable ready-to-use therapeutic and complementary food, based on locally available ingredients (such as rice, lentils and chickpeas), Q-MAT (a birthing mat), and a social enterprise model for detecting undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) in the community. \n\nA significant contribution has been made by our researchers in providing a clearer picture of the spread of antibiotic resistance in Bangladesh. In 2017, icddr,b has begun a five-year implementation research project to generate evidence and promote the use of evidence-based research and policy analysis for health planning and decision making. \n\nicddr,b has been conducting studies with marginalised and stigmatised populations at risk of HIV, translating evidence into policy, and developing interventions to generate impact at the population level. Integral to its research, icddr,b provides high-quality care, free of charge, to over 200,000 Bangladeshis annually.\n\n•\ticddr,b’s response to COVID-19 pandemic\nicddr,b has been actively monitoring the development of novel coronavirus disease pandemic since December 2019, with particular focus on the health and well-being of the people of Bangladesh, as well as on the continuity of research, and hospital operations, which treats annually more than 200,000 diarrhoeal disease patients free-of-charge. icddr,b has been providing support to the Government of Bangladesh and its partners, responding to the urgent needs of the country. \n\nicddr,b has been working closely with the Government of Bangladesh in its COVID-19 response through various capacities from disease diagnosis to capacity building and research activities. In addition, numbers of research projects and trial are ongoing on COVID-19. icddr,b is currently working in collaboration with UNICEF to setup a 200 bed COVID-19 hospital for the vulnerable FDMN population at icddr,b’s Teknaf field site in Cox&#039;s Bazar. In an effort to support the livelihood of the transgender and sex worker and the local under privileged group affected due to OVID-19 humanitarian assistance has been provided. Capacity development assistance to local health service providers on critical case management of patients suffering from COVID-19 and providing COVID-19 care to all icddr,b staff, their dependents and family members living with them at this critical situation within its set up are phenomenal.\n\n•\tCollaboration: \nicddr,b has worked with over 100 organisations including Government of Bangladesh (GoB), other national governments, international institutions and national and international civil society partners and NGOs. icddr,b is supported by over 50 donor countries and organisations, including the host country government, UN agencies, USAID, DFID, foundations, universities, research institutes and private-sector organisations and companies. icddr,b has ample experience of successful collaboration with internal and external stakeholders including Government of Bangladesh and reputed research institutions/universities worldwide to carry forward our research agenda. Our work has had a major impact on the health of people in Bangladesh – and in other countries of the global South. We develop innovative products and generate rigorous evidence that has influenced health policy and practice in Bangladesh and globally. The institution, at any given time, has more than 100 research projects ongoing.\n\n•\tInstitutional Review capacity: \nicddr,b attaches great importance to the development of high-standard research proposals (technically and scientifically sound and meeting international ethical standards) by its scientists and collaborating institutions. We have satisfactory processes in place to meet Research Integrity and Ethics. icddr,b’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) consists of four mandatory committees: Research Review Committee (RRC), Ethical Review Committee (ERC), Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (AEEC) and Programme Coordination Committee (PCC). Besides these mandatory committees, there are several subcommittees of the ERC: Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Audit/Monitoring Subcommittee. In any given year, icddr,b is subject to more than thirty project audits done by external independent auditors. Moreover, there is an institutional audit every year. In addition, internal functions are regularly audited by the Internal Oversight (IO) department of icddr,b. icddr,b’s Conflict of Interest Policy requires Board of Trustee Members, management and staff members to declare conflict of interest annually. icddr,b is committed to strict adherence and any violation of conflict of interest policy may constitute cause for disciplinary or other administrative action pursuant to Staff Regulations and Rules.\n\n•\tResearch facilities and resources: \nicddr,b hosts some of the finest research laboratories and its clinical diagnostic laboratories serve as reference laboratories for clinical diagnostic analysis of human disease cohorts and control subjects. The diagnostic laboratories are the only accredited labs under ISO15189 (quality) and ISO15190 (safety) in Bangladesh for as many as 160 different tests and parameters. Approximately 1500 patients and individuals avail diagnostic services each day from the diagnostic OPD of the Centre, in addition to the in-patient cohorts and patients referred from icddr,b staff clinic. icddr,b also operates other research support facilities such as the Genomics Centre that provides exquisite services in the areas of genomics, metagenomics, exon sequencing and microRNA sequencing etc. A state of art animal house and a bacteriological media facility also cater to the requirements of the researchers from within icddr,b and outside collaborators. The bio-safety and bio-security as well as laboratory quality monitoring and quality assurance services are ensured. icddr,b also hosts an impressive and well maintained bio-repository which houses all archived biological materials in an ordered and classified manner. \n\n•\tTraining: \nicddr,b offers a huge range of technical training to increase expertise and capacity for public health and allied practitioners and researchers in Bangladesh and beyond. Our training unit works in collaboration with scientific divisions/units within icddr,b and institutions/universities/organizations globally to enhance visibility of icddr,b and  its sphere of influence in the policy, program and practice.\n\nFulfilling its commitment to share discoveries with the world, icddr,b has trained an incredible 50,000 health professionals from over 87 countries in public health education to improve health outcomes of disadvantaged populations, particularly poor women and children. This training has had extraordinary impact over the years building capacity of foreign and Bangladeshi students, while also deepening the knowledge base and skills of practicing professionals.\n\n•\tAward and achievement: \nOne of icddr,b&#039;s greatest contributions lies in its diligent dissemination and scale-up of findings and discoveries through this large network. icddrb has shared its wealth of knowledge with the world by training more than 50,000 health professionals from over 87 countries. icddr,b&#039;s focus and contributions to the humanitarian work  has earned national and international recognition, including the UNICEF Maurice Pate award for service to children (1986), the Government of Bangladesh&#039;s highest honour, The Independence Day Award (2005), the first-ever Gates Award for Global Health (2001) and most recently, the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize (2017). Besides these, icddr,b also won USAID’s ‘Science and Technology for Development Award’ in 1987. In 2018, icddr,b researchers published more than 396 scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals. \n\n•\tFinancial capacity: \nThe organization is financially stable having an annual budget of US$60 million per year on an average over the last 3 years. As an international health research institute, icddr,b is allowed by the local regulations to receive funds from foreign sponsors. Currently, the institute receives grants from donors like DFID, UKAid, Sida, the Gates Foundation, US Agencies, the Global Fund, EU, NIH etc. icddr,b has both local and foreign currency accounts and they can be reconciled. icddr,b has two budget procedures from preparation to execution. Project budgets are approved by Director Finance and Donors, whereas, the institutional budget is prepared annually and approved by Board of Trustees (BoT). The respective section head prepares the institutional budget; it is reviewed by Finance before submitting to the BoT for approval. The ERP system has strong budgetary control mechanisms which facilitates variance analysis reports on monthly, quarterly and annual basis. \n",

    "description": "We are an alliance of networks. IDA brings together over 1,100 organisations of persons with disabilities and their families from across eight global and six regional networks.\n\nTogether we promote the rights of persons with disabilities across the United Nations&#039; efforts to advance human rights and sustainable development. We support organisations of persons with disabilities to hold their governments to account and advocate for change locally, nationally and internationally.\n\nThe cornerstone of our work is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD). We promote the effective and full implementation of the UN CRPD, and compliance by governments and the UN System, through the active and coordinated involvement of representative organisations of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and international levels. The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals are also integral to IDA&#039;s work to promote inclusive, sustainable development in line with the UN CRPD and the rights of persons with disabilities.\n\nWith member organisations around the world, IDA represents the estimated one billion people worldwide living with disabilities. This is the world’s largest – and most frequently overlooked – marginalised group. IDA, with its unique composition as a network of the foremost international disability rights organisations, is the most authoritative representation of persons with disabilities on the global level, and acknowledged as such by the United Nations system both in New York and Geneva.",

    "description": "The International Network of People who Use Drugs (INPUD) is a global peer-based organisation that seeks to promote the health and defend the rights of people who use drugs. INPUD will expose and challenge stigma, discrimination, and the criminalisation of people who use drugs and its impact on the drug-using community’s health and rights. INPUD will achieve this through processes of empowerment and advocacy at the international level, while supporting empowerment and advocacy at community, national and regional levels.\n\nINPUD is a movement of people who use drugs (current and former) who support the Vancouver Declaration. The Vancouver Declaration sets out the demands of people who use drugs, emphasising that their human rights must be respected and their health and wellbeing prioritised. INPUD is a global network that seeks to represent people who use drugs in international agencies such as the United Nations and with those undertaking international development work. We believe that people who use drugs should be meaningfully represented in decision-making processes that affect our lives. INPUD is committed to demonstrating at country level how people who use drugs can constructively contribute to the development and delivery of services for our community. We believe that we have a unique insight that can help money be spent wisely thus delivering better results for individuals and the wider community. We are asking the international community to stop always framing us as the problem and instead to recognise that we are part of the solution when is comes to addressing problems associated with drugs and drug policy around the world.",

ITC remains the only international organization focused solely on trade development for developing and transition economies. To deliver effective trade-related technical assistance (TRTA) and to achieve the goal of expanding exports requires all the major players, including ITC, to develop effective working partnerships as well as greater levels of coherence and coordination.

    "description": "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is a membership Union uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together.\n\nCreated in 1948, IUCN has evolved into the world’s largest and most diverse environmental network. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its 1,300 Member organisations and the input of some 16,000 experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. Our experts are organised into six commissions dedicated to species survival, environmental law, protected areas, social and economic policy, ecosystem management, and education and communication.\n\nThe ability to convene diverse stakeholders and provide the latest science, objective recommendations and on-the-ground expertise drives IUCN’s mission of informing and empowering conservation efforts worldwide. We provide a neutral forum in which governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples groups, faith-based organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges.\n\nBy facilitating these solutions, IUCN provides governments and institutions at all levels with the impetus to achieve universal goals, including on biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development, which IUCN was instrumental in defining.\n\nCombined, our knowledge base and diverse membership make IUCN an incubator and trusted repository of best practices, conservation tools, and international guidelines and standards. As the only environmental organisation with official United Nations Observer Status, IUCN ensures that nature conservation has a voice at the highest level of international governance.\n\nIUCN’s expertise and extensive network provide a solid foundation for a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects around the world. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people’s well-being. They also produce a wealth of data and information which feeds into IUCN’s analytical capacity.\n\nThrough their affiliation with IUCN, Member organisations are part of a democratic process, voting Resolutions which drive the global conservation agenda. They meet every four years at the IUCN World Conservation Congress to set priorities and agree on the Union’s work programme. IUCN congresses have produced several key international environmental agreements including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the World Heritage Convention, and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. We continue to help these conventions strengthen and evolve so that they can respond to emerging challenges.\n\nOur Member organisations are represented by the IUCN Council – the governing body. Headquartered in Switzerland, IUCN Secretariat comprises around 900 staff in more than 50 countries. ",

Internews has been a key stakeholder and driver of change in media development and media sector reform globally for nearly 20 years. We have established a wide network of regional offices in turn connected to thousands of journalists, civil society organisations, government institutions, universities, media groups and regulatory bodies. Our programmes have ranged from rapid-response efforts to stabilise the media sector, to long-term programmes to embed increased citizen engagement, information access and key thematic strands into the regional information ecosystem. This deep-seated knowledge and expertise is further supported by strong relations around the world with influential reform agents within governments and the most senior/respected media stakeholders.

IF provided legal counsel and referral, assistance with documentation, and life-skills education; IF built vocational skills and provided micro-grants to help with livelihood. Since the start of 2017, IF has been working with returnee and IDP women in Nenawa, Anbar, and Salaheddin, through the Empowering Returnee Women project (ERW) where IF trained returnee women in leadership and advocacy skills to be ambassadors for their communities with local authorities and civic leaders. Through individual and group meetings with community women and with local officials, in which needs were discussed and prioritized, women leaders won the trust of both groups of stakeholders, worked with local authorities to provide better services, and were thus able to improve living conditions for their communities.

Within this context, the development of training facilities and educational programs for Ghanaian postgraduates and technical staff is a priority.\n\nAs a result of our continued effort in pursuit of this objective, KCCR was designated as an African Network for Diagnosis and Drug Discovery Innovation (ANDi) centre of excellence for applied biomedical research in 2011. This is in addition to the centre’s recognition as a WHO reference laboratory for Buruli Ulcer diagnosis. Our objective is to bring both the scientists and their ideas in this network and platform to conduct research in tropical diseases.",

Sa vision est celle d’un monde où l’on aurait transformé les rapports de domination entre les femmes et les hommes et entre le Nord et le Sud en relations construites sur l’égalité et la solidarité. Elle reconnait l’interdépendance des sociétés et l’enrichissement mutuel. Elle s&#039;adresse au Nord et au Sud, aux instances et personnes susceptibles de jouer un rôle multiplicateur, tant dans le secteur marchand et non-marchand que de la coopération au développement (institutions gouvernementales et non- gouvernementales), des institutions internationales, du monde politique, des syndicats et des médias.",

    "description": "MASUM was co-founded by Dr. Manisha Gupte and Dr. Ramesh Awasthi in 1987 during their five year stay in the drought-prone Purandar block of Pune district. It evolved out of a commitment to women’s rights within and outside the home, working with a feminist perspective and a human rights approach. MASUM’s primary belief is that people can resolve their own problems collectively with some amount of external support; thus, rather than create dependence on itself, MASUM focused on strengthening people’s perspectives on democracy, equality, secularism and social justice. \nIn order to emphasis people’s participation in decision-making at every level, the staff is mostly local, especially women from marginalised sections of rural society. Leadership building from subordinated groups since its inception helped to build a strong second line leadership; thereby MASUM meticulously avoided the pitfall of founders handing over the organization to their children or family members.\nMASUM’s community level involvement is primarily with rural women in perennially drought- prone areas of Pune and Ahmednagar districts of Maharashtra state. Acknowledging that women are not a homogenous category and that multiple systems of domination - such as caste, class, religion and patriarchy operate in an intersectional manner, MASUM predominantly works with subordinated and minority-groups. \nSome of MASUM’s on-going activities include women&#039;s right to health and savings and credit programme (SHGs), addressing gender-based violence, building a progressive perspective among young people, and enhancing their rights in all areas of life. Political participation of women, both as elected representatives and as empowered citizens, strengthening of child rights through village-based children’s councils (Bal Panchayats), and enhancing women’s right to property ownership are ongoing interventions too. Men are encouraged to participate in MASUM’s work, with women taking on leadership roles. Every programme of MASUM is interconnected with another, so that people’s human rights are realised in multiple ways.\nAt the state and national levels, we are committed to training and capacity building of NGOs, CBOs and a variety of stakeholders in increasing people’s access to economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights. MASUM is recognised as a credible training institute on gender, health rights, ESC rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), violence against women (VAW), and dalit and minority rights. We are also involved with campaigns and networks that strengthen women’s rights from the local to the international levels. \n",

Human Rights First announced awarding the 2018 Roger N. Baldwin Medal of Liberty to Mwatana. In the same year, the 10th International Hrant Dink Award was granted to Mwatana for .informing the world about the status of human rights in Yemen and for struggling against rights violations in the country",

    "description": "Namati is dedicated to putting the power of the law in the hands of people. Law is supposed to be a sacred thread that ties us together, and protects each one of us. But for billions of people around the world the law is broken. It’s an abstraction, or worse, a threat, but not something we can use to exercise our basic rights. Namati is building a global movement of grassroots legal advocates who give people the power to understand, use, and shape the law. These advocates form a dynamic, creative frontline that can squeeze justice out of even broken systems. Legal empowerment advocates treat their clients as empowered citizens rather than victims requiring an expert service. Instead of “I will solve this problem for you,” our message is: “We will solve this together, and you will grow stronger in the process.” We track data on every case, and together with our clients we use that information to advocate for systemic changes, like better policies for land governance in Liberia, environmental regulation in India, and healthcare delivery in Mozambique. Namati additionally convenes the global legal empowerment network, which is made up of over 1,500 groups from all over the world. We are learning from one another and working together to bring justice everywhere. ",

    "description": "NatureFinance (NF) is Swiss non-governmental organization dedicated to aligning global finance with nature positive outcomes. NF formally operated as Finance for Biodiversity Initiative (F4B), an initiative established in 2019 with a core mission of increasing the materiality of biodiversity in financial decision making and so better align global finance with nature conservation and restoration. In June 2022, NF became a fully operational outfit, registered in Switzerland, building and expanding on F4B’s high-impact work and partnerships. Since then, our organization has rapidly become a leading voice in the emerging field of nature finance and the bioeconomy.\nOur work spans national and international levels, focusing on developing innovative financial mechanisms, policies, and metrics to channel investments towards nature-positive outcomes. Some of our key initiatives include:\n1.\tDeveloping frameworks for sovereign debt instruments linked to nature performance, which have been piloted in several countries.\n2.\tAdvising governments and financial institutions on strategies to align economic policies with biodiversity conservation goals.\n3.\tConducting groundbreaking research on the economic risks of nature loss and the opportunities presented by nature-based solutions.",

When Dr. Saraswathi Iyer, HoD of Acharya Nagarjuna University joined in one of our Youth Leaders’ Capacity Building, she said, “NewBeginnings is really a New Beginning for the marginalised”\nNCT became a registered ngo on 23rd Nov, 2009. It all started when three of the founding members who have long years of professional experience in social works decided to have a ngo that thinks differently and is bold enough to stand with those who are vulnerable. We deliberately choose target groups who are ignored, live in utter poverty for generations; We choose areas where others don’t usually go. We don’t expect sustainability in our projects. We aim at Chain of Sustainable Impact in our projects. What we mean by CSI – the beneficiary of a project should become a benefactor to her/his own neighbour. A trained youth of our project should train another youth in the same vocational skill; a child who is sponsored right now for her education should promise that she would educate another poor child when she is able to earn; a women group which has been trained in how to counsel and avoid domestic violence should talk to women in their neighbourhoods. Thus, we multiply the grant we receive from our donors. \nAt the heart of our mission is transparency. A well-organized Management Structure headed by the Governing Body and is well connected to the stakeholders of our programmes.\nNewBeginnings has a clearly written down policies and System in place. Be sure, you will be working with a professionally managed organisation: A clearly written down Management policies, Staff polices, Finance Polices, Volunteers’ Policies and Networking Policies etc guide us in our daily work.\nWhere there is no hope, we begin to give hope; where people feel that they have come to a dead-end, we want to start again. NewBeginnings gives a New Beginning in every heart; show them a way to live. Life it to the full.",

We also aim to advance the education of medical professionals through the provision of educational programmes and in-service training.\nOur work also focuses on both development and humanitarian medical assistance to improve the quality of life for those who are suffering from poor health provisions.  \n\nIn the early years, PAC gained a reputation for rapid responses, particularly in humanitarian crises, sending medical teams to deliver surgical operations and emergency care to those in dire situations. This has laid the organization for its continued success in various regions.\nOver the years, PAC has extended its operations to more than 42 countries, including Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Liberia, Guinea, Congo, Rwanda, Sudan, South Sudan, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Malawi, Comoros, Sierra Leone, Libya, Tunisia, Syria, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, India, and Yemen. PAC has also established a presence in countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UK, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Malawi, Nigeria, and Turkey, tailoring its services to the specific healthcare needs of local populations.\n\n \nWe conducted over 200 medical and surgical camps, performing more than 100,000 surgeries and serving over 1 million beneficiaries. Additionally, we support national health facilities in countries where we have a presence, contributing to improving the uptake of health services and strengthening the local health system. These efforts reflect the profound impact PAC has had on global health and well-being for all.\n \nAs we look to the future, PAC remains dedicated to improving healthcare access and outcomes for the most vulnerable, continuing its legacy of compassion, resilience, and innovation.",

    "description": "The Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAG) is one of the leading Civil Society Organisations involved in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) programming in Ghana. The Association believes that based on available data from national surveys, SRHR issues are, and will continue to be critical in Ghana’s national development discourse. Although much progress has been made, a lot still remains to be done. This is especially in terms of young people’s inability to freely access SRHR information and services due largely to socio-cultural and economic barriers. This is reflected in the high unmet need for SRHR services among young people resulting in high unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections including HIV and AIDS. ",

    "description": "ABOUT QRF\n\n“What the Arab world needs today is an educational revolution; we need a fundamental change that will fulfil every parent’s ambition to provide their child with a quality education.”\n\nHer Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah, 2013\n\nFrom its founding in 2013 by Her Majesty Queen Rania of Jordan, the Queen Rania Foundation (QRF) has aimed to be the premier resource on educational issues, in Jordan and around the Arab world, and to act as an incubator for new ideas and initiatives. In the firm belief that education is the foundation of economic, political and social development, QRF’s mandate has focused on identifying gaps and opportunities for developing new education programs, with the aim of influencing policy and creating educational change on the ground. QRF’s focus is perhaps best exemplified through the launch of Edraak.org an online education platform that localized open source technology developed by Harvard and MIT to reach over a million learners across the Arab world with free high quality educational material in less than 3 years.\n\nThe Middle East region is now the world’s largest producer and host of forced displacement. With the number of refugees and displaced people across the Middle East reaching almost 15 million, QRF believes it is imperative now more than ever to reinvent education from the ground up. Education must suit the needs of a shifting geopolitical landscape and a more mobile population – forced or otherwise.\n\nRe-inventing School Education\nJordan and the Middle East region are at a critical point. Whereas others may choose to dwell on the challenges, Her Majesty has always maintained that “Pessimism doesn’t change the reality; it prolongs the status quo… Optimism and faith coupled with pragmatism change the reality”. It is imperative upon the people of Jordan and the region to embrace the current status quo as an opportunity to disrupt existing legacy systems of education, healthcare, and infrastructure. In that light, and in response to the incoming waves of refugee children in Jordan, QRF aims to position Jordan as the ideal setting to reinvent school education through an impact focused approach to learning.\n\nOver the next 5 years, QRF will focus on a subset of public schools that are hosting both Jordanian and Syrian refugee students, combined with learners that are out of school for a number of factors. The Foundation will aim to reach 150,000 school-age students between 3 and 15 years of age with teacher-targeted localized innovative solutions that improve learner’s socio-emotional skills, numeracy, and literacy.\n\nTo successfully disrupt the education sector, it will be critical to start at the bottom of the pyramid where resources are constrained and there is an imperative to do more with less. QRF will identify and channel funding to the most suitable innovations (technological or otherwise), localize them when necessary, and run rigorous assessments for impact. The defining aspects of QRF’s approach are the focus on rigorous evaluation methods to “solve for impact” and the mixed funding approach to ensure that both public and private sector thinking can be combined to solve these critical challenges. Successful deployments will then be scaled via public-private partnerships across the Jordanian public school system. QRF will widely share the results of all of its interventions to ensure that any lessons learned are accessible to educators and learners across the globe –especially those working within developing settings and forced migration challenges.\n\nWithin its target schools, QRF will center on 5 areas for its interventions. The focus areas have been identified through a rigorous research process using internal and external experts to ensure limited resources are directed to the issues with the highest potential for impact on learning and society. The five focus areas are: improving learning outcomes for boys, creating more structured classroom pedagogy, introducing regular formative assessment, creating strong school leadership and positive culture, and raising parental awareness and engagement in the early years of a child’s life.  These focus areas will be buttressed by three crosscutting themes that have always been central to QRF’s operations and interventions: a clear understanding of the transformative power of technology (and its limitations), provision of a healthy socioemotional school climate, and finally ensuring selected interventions are readily scalable on national levels.\n\nAs a small country, with very little resources, and in a turbulent region, Jordan has always relied on the support of visionary friends and partners to help it develop into a model of stability and moderation across the region. In the same vein, QRF seeks the support of the international community and leaders in the public and private sector to help it transform Jordan into the ideal setting to catalyze education for the developing world and especially the Middle East region. As stability returns to war torn countries such as Yemen, Libya and Syria there will need to be clear models of education that can help them make up for lost time.",

In 2009, this program evolved into WorldCoaches. With a new name came a focus on combining football training with developing life skills to empower young people and their community. By balancing football training with life skills coaching, a WorldCoach teaches children and youth to become better footballers and at the same time guides them in issues faced in their daily lives. The program focuses on three main pillars: personal development, health and social cohesion.",

This proposal therefore aims to address the pervasive issue of corruption and its adverse effects on service delivery in these critical sectors in the Rwenzori region.\n\nThe project further seeks to address the challenge of marginalized groups’ limited access to information about government programs, hindering their ability to engage with duty bearers and benefit from these initiatives. \n\nIt seeks to empower the marginalized communities of the Rwenzori region i.e. women, People With Disabilities (PWDs), refugees and youth with information to effectively engage and demand for accountability from the duty bearers for effective service delivery. The project further seeks to engage the target group in monitoring government programs in the health, education, environment and production sector, evidence-based reporting and involvement in decision making processes. \n\nThe Project seeks to contribute to the British High Commission key priority of promoting good governance and combating corruption. To this end, RAC intends to bridge the gap between leaders/duty bearers and the marginalized groups by creating accountability platforms for engagement on critical service delivery issues between the citizenry and the duty bearers. \n\nAdditionally, joint monitoring, advocacy forums and follow up of issues to logical conclusion will be conducted with specific government institutions including the Inter Agency Forum (IAF) i.e. the Inspector General of Government (IGG), police, judiciary, Office of the Auditor General, Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets (PPDA). \n\nFurther still, RAC will work with the media and CSOs of like-minded organizations to sensitize masses on corruption and Human rights to enable them to report all forms of corruption and Human Rights abuse for action by relevant stakeholders. This will be done through media campaign and sensitization camps. RAC will also support and facilitate the existing semi-informal and formal structures and networks to popularize and mobilize the marginalized groups to utilize the existing platforms like budget conferences to ensure that their priorities are considered in the approved plans and budgets for financing. \n\nRAC will further work with relevant stakeholders to simplify and disseminate key government documents like the approved district and sub-county plans and budgets, procurement plans and audit reports to the citizenry to enhance monitoring, engagement of duty bearers for accountability and participation in government programs\n1.2.\tGeographic Summary: \nProvide a summary (district level) of the geographic coverage for the project\nThe Project will be implemented across 60 sub-counties in the10 Districts of the Rwenzori region i.e. Kabarole, Kamwenge, Kitagwenda, Bundibugyo, Kyenjojo, Kyegegwa, Kasese, Ntoroko, Bunyangabu and Fort Portal City.",

    "description": "QUI SOMMES-NOUS?\nLe Secrétariat Permanent des Organisations Non Gouvernementales (SPONG) est le premier collectif des ONG et Associations de développement (AD) qui intervient au Burkina Faso. A travers la promotion de la culture de la participation citoyenne et de la redevabilité, le SPONG fédère, coordonne la participation au développement des ONG/AD et porte leurs voix dans l’élaboration, la mise en oeuvre et l’évaluation des politiques publiques en tant qu’un des porte-parole de la société civile.\nNOTRE VISION « Un Burkina Faso, où les ONG/AD-Fondations ont une voix et les capacités pour participer à la réalisation d&#039;une société juste, équitable, pacifique, résiliente et démocratique »\nNOS VALEURS : BONNE GOUVERNANCE - DIVERSITE - DIALOGUE - SOLIDARITE\nHISTORIQUE\nPour faire face à l’ampleur des besoins et au souci d’une meilleure efficacité dans le contexte de la grande sécheresse qui a frappé le sahel entre 1970 -1974, 17 ONG ont décidé de se regrouper dans un cadre fédérateur. Objectif, mieux se connaitre, agir sur le terrain avec plus de cohérence et aller ensemble en dialogue avec l’Etat et les partenaires techniques et financiers. Cela a aboutit en avril 1975, à la création du collectif SPONG, déclaré conformément à la loi n°18/AL du 31 Août 1959, sous le Récépissé N° 10/IS/DGI du 09 avril 1975 et agrée par le Gouvernement du Burkina Faso à travers une convention signée en 1987. Chevalier de l’Ordre du mérite burkinabè en 2004, le SPONG a été élevé au rang d’Officier de l’Ordre du mérite en 2014.\nNOS MISSIONS\nLe SPONG a une triple mission:\n Une mission de représentation et de service\nd’interface entre le gouvernement, les partenaires non gouvernementaux au développement dans le processus de décentralisation, les initiatives à la base et la démarche associative;\nUne mission d’information et de facilitation à l’égard des mouvements et associations de la société civile pour la mise en commun de leurs actions;\n Une mission de mobilisation et d’animation propre à favoriser la mobilisation de l’opinion des acteurs non gouvernementales touchant à la vie économique et sociale du pays.\nNOS OBJECTIFS\n Favoriser / faciliter la concertation entre les ONG membres d’une part, et entre les ONG membres et les organismes étatiques d’autres parts, en vue de parvenir à une meilleure efficacité;\n Constituer un réseau d’information des ONG et associations, du public, du gouvernement, des orga-nismes privés et publics interafricains et internatio-naux, sur les activités des membres, les financements obtenus, les projets exécutés et ceux en cours d’exé-cution;\n Développer les contacts et assurer la concertation avec les collectifs d’ONG du Burkina Faso et des autres pays pour favoriser la mise en relation des ONG membres avec les ONG ou organismes exté-rieurs;\n Promouvoir les intérêts de ses membres vis-à-vis de l’Etat et de tout autre partenaire.\nDOMAINES D’INTERVENTIONS\nL’information à travers la collecte et la diffusion des opportunités d’actions et de financements au profit des ONG/AD membres auprès des Partenaires Techniques et Financiers;\n• Le réseautage à travers l’animation de huit (08) groupes thématiques internes et bien d’autres réseaux nationaux et internationaux pour la conduite des actions de plaidoyer au niveau national et international (Aide Publique au Développement, Accord de Partenariat Economique, OMD…);\n• L’influence des politiques publiques à travers la représentation de la société civile burkinabé dans les structures de référence au plan national et international;\n• La capitalisation et la valorisation des bonnes pratiques des ONG/AD membres à travers des recherches et l’animation d’une bibliothèque spécialisée, un site portail et un bulletin d’information trimestriel;\n• Le développement et le renforcement des capacités des membres sur des sujets transversaux (fundraising, vie associative, partenariat, dialogue citoyen…).\nSTRUCTURES DE GOUVERNANCE\nL’assemblée générale\nElle est l’instance suprême qui regroupe tous les membres.

Both charities were founded in mid-1980s in response to the catastrophic Ethiopian famine and the droughts that plagued many central African countries.",

    "description": "Mindset is a development, social research, and implementation consultancy firm that has designed and implemented impactful services and solutions in humanitarian and development settings since 2010. We bring diverse, cutting-edge, and in-country experience across the Monitoring, Evaluation, Research, and Learning (MERL), and capacity-building realms. Our goal is to provide our partners with services that are evidence-based and with a deep understanding of the social, economic, cultural, and political contexts in which they work, to improve development outcomes and humanization outreach globally. \n\n•\tResearch Rigor. At our core, we are a group of dynamic data scientists and research professionals. Our expertise covers all aspects of data collection, including quantitative and qualitative research design, sampling, questionnaire and interview guide formulation, scripting on data collection platforms, recruitment and training of staff, management of fieldwork staff, data processing, and data analysis and reporting. We also put in place strong quality control protocols, by ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data collected during research. This includes conducting thorough reviews, implementing quality control measures, reviewing tools and procedures, conducting data cleaning and validation checks, and providing training and support to field staff.   \n\n•\tLarge-Scale Data Collection and Outreach Activities. We are experts at rapidly mobilizing teams for large and mega-sized enumeration projects. We possess the organizational capacity to handle a wide array of enumeration exercises, including fielding nationwide surveys covering hard-to-reach populations. We use robust data collection tools, which are highly scalable and enable the gathering of geospatial information.\n\n•\tExpertise with Vulnerable Populations. Through years of experience, we have developed expertise in working with vulnerable, under-served, and hard-to-reach populations. Our well-trained team has the knowledge and capability to work sensitively with refugees, displaced populations, children, people with disabilities, and other social minorities.\n\n•\tProgrammatic M&E and TPM. Our technical team has extensive experience in conducting monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and third-party monitoring (TPM) for projects, starting from developing the theory of change to Data Quality Assessments (DQA) to performing the data collection and monitoring activities. We work with organizations to operationalize their M&E plans, first by advising on the best data sources for measuring outcomes, and then through data collection at every project stage: baseline, midline, and end-line.\n\n•\tContinuous Learning and Improvement. We have tested and deployed powerful tools and methods to track progress and improvement in real time. This enables our clients to track data and progress on a specific effort or intervention to ensure their interventions are actively monitored, continuously improved, and possibly scaled if success is evident. \n\n•\tImplementation Excellence. We are experts at rapidly mobilizing teams for large projects. We possess the organizational capacity to handle a wide array of technical and management exercises, including fielding staff nationwide and engaging hard-to-reach populations. We have tested and deployed powerful tools and methods to track progress and improvement in real time. This is to ensure interventions are actively monitored, continuously improved, and possibly scaled if success is evident.\n  \n•\tCapacity Building. We are focused on advancing and growing the research and data-driven sectors wherever we work. We engage our clients and beneficiaries in a collaborative, interactive training process and come away from our capacity-building events with practical new skills and targeted knowledge.  \n\n•\tResponsive Management. Serving as responsive and valuable partners to our clients is at the apex of our mandate and is the driving force behind our success. We often serve as a go-to in-country partner, providing a range of solutions, including administrative functions like implementing large-scale interventions and activities and organizing complex events. \n \n•\tGeographic Presence. Mindset is incorporated in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Nigeria, and Ukraine. We also operate through field staff and affiliate offices in Lebanon and Tunisia. We are able to mobilize in almost any setting or context if given the appropriate set-up time, even if we have not operated previously. This is due to our agile approach to setting up operations and vast international network of consultants and partners.\n",

    "description": "Stars Foundation is an independent charity founded and funded by His Excellency Amr. A. Al Dabbagh and the Dabbagh Group of companies. The Foundation’s vision is to “improve the lives of disadvantaged children and their communities globally”. This aspiration is realised through a range of initiatives designed to tackle development challenges in some of the poorest countries in the world.  Through a range of approaches, Stars aims to support local actors to address problems they identify by providing access to funding and non-financial support. \nStars believes that well-run local organisations are best placed to respond to the needs of their communities and the young people in their care. All too often however, they are constrained by a rigid approach to partnerships and funding which can limit their effectiveness. \nStars’ flagship activity is the annual ‘Impact Awards’ which recognise and reward effective and well-managed local organisations working in the fields of child health, education, protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). Stars aims to select a winner and runner-up in each field across three regions: Africa-Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America-the Caribbean. The Awards are open to applications from the 100 countries with the highest rates of under-five mortality (http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/apply/eligibility-2/). ",

Over the last 30 years, we have created transformative change in the lives of LGBTQ+ people in the UK, helping win equal rights around marriage, having children and inclusive education.\n\nOur campaigns drive positive change for our communities, and our sustained change and empowerment programmes ensure that LGBTQ+ people can thrive throughout our lives. We make sure that the world hears and learns from our communities, and our work is grounded in evidence and expertise.\n\nWe face rising intolerance degrading our hard-won rights, but we won&#039;t be silenced. Our work continues until the world we imagine is the world we live in.",

From its beginning, The Hunger Project has focused on identifying and implementing high leverage strategies to achieve its objectives. Instead of serving as a relief organization, The Hunger Project operates as a strategic organization and as such, has reinvented itself time and again over the years to meet each challenge along the path of ending hunger. While adapted to meet local challenges and opportunities wherever we work, all our programs have at their foundation three essential pillars: 1)Start by empowering women as key change agents 2) Mobilizing entire communities into self-reliant action 3)Fostering effective partnerships to engage local government. Vision: A world where every woman, man and child leads a healthy, fulfilling life of self-reliance and dignity. Mission:To end hunger and poverty by pioneering sustainable, grassroots, women-centered strategies and advocating for their widespread adoption in countries throughout the world.

    "description": "TradeMark Africa (TMA), formerly TradeMark East Africa, is an Aid-for-Trade organisation that was established in 2010, with the aim of growing prosperity through increased trade. TMA operates on a not-for-profit basis and is funded by: Belgium, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. TMA works closely with regional intergovernmental organisations, including the African Union (AU), the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, the East African Community (EAC), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), national Governments, the private sector and civil society organisations.\n\nThe first two strategic periods of TMA (2010-2023) have contributed to substantial gains for trade and regional integration in East Africa and the Horn of Africa in terms of decreased cargo transit times (reduction of 16.5% on the Northern Corridor from Mombasa to Bujumbura), improved border efficiency (the time to cross targeted one stop border posts has been reduced by an average of 70%), and reduced barriers to trade. The continental-wide shift and rebrand to TMA was officially launched in West Africa in January 2023, with Ghana being the first country of operations in the region.\n\nWhile continuing to leverage our core expertise in trade facilitation, we will evolve our focus to harness the potential of digitalisation, support African exporters to pioneer low carbon trade, address the core trade factors behind food security and promote inclusive trade. By increasing trade volumes, and enhancing the sustainability and inclusiveness of trade, we aim to deliver large-scale job creation, poverty reduction and enhanced economic growth.\n\nIn 2022, TMA set up a catalytic finance fund, Trade Catalyst Africa (TCA), that will pilot commercially viable projects for creating trade infrastructure (both physical and digital) as well as increasing access to Trade Finance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nTMA&#039;s headquarters are in Nairobi, Kenya. Operations and offices are in: EAC Secretariat - Arusha, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somaliland, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.trademarkafrica.com ",

This means giving all workers the opportunity to come together to improve their situation in the belief that acting as an organised group is more effective than acting alone. \n\nHow we work\nUnion to Union’s work is primarily geared towards building up the capacity of unions in low and middle-income countries for organising, negotiating, advocacy work and promoting gender equality and democracy.

    "description": "The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is one of the fastest and most effective ways to support rapid humanitarian response for people affected by natural disasters and armed conflict. CERF receives voluntary contributions year-round to provide immediate funding for life-saving humanitarian action anywhere in the world.\n\nERF pools contributions from donors – mainly governments, but also, foundations, companies, charities and individuals – into a single fund with a $450 million annual target.\n\nThis money is set aside for immediate use at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources.\n\nIn emergencies, humanitarian organizations apply jointly for funding. Funds are immediately released if these proposals meet CERF’s criteria, i.e. the needs are urgent and the proposed activities will save lives.\n\nWith money available immediately, relief organizations can deliver food, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other life-saving aid faster and more efficiently.\n\nCERF allocations are designed to complement other humanitarian funding sources, such as country-based pooled funds and bilateral funding.\n\nCERF makes money available when it is needed most: at the beginning of a crisis, when time is of the essence and it is critical that emergency relief operations get under way quickly.\n\nBut mobilizing funds can take time and as time passes, more lives are lost.\nCERF helps to remedy this problem with rapid response grants, which can be approved in as little as 48 hours.\n\nCERF provides funding to the world’s most neglected crises. When a disaster fades from the headlines, or never makes the headlines, it is much harder to raise funds. The need for help, however, is no less significant.\n\nCERF helps to address this challenge with underfunded emergencies grants, which are disbursed twice a year for emergencies that have not attracted sufficient funding.\n\nCERF has a loan facility of $30 million. Up to one-year loans are provided based on indication that donor funding is forthcoming.\n\nIn an average year, CERF allocates approximately $450 million to humanitarian operations in some 50 different countries. Since 2006, more than $3.7 billion has been allocated to help millions of people in 92 countries and territories across the world.\n\nCERF funding is available to UN agencies, funds and programmes and the International Organization for Migration.\n\nNGOs are important partners in the CERF allocation decision making processes and receive CERF funding when they carry out work for recipient organizations.\n\nCERF is funded by voluntary contributions. Since 2006, CERF has received almost $3.8 billion from 125 UN Member States and observers, regional and local authorities, and other public and private donors. A third of CERF’s contributors have also received support from the fund.\n\nThe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) manages CERF on behalf of the UN Secretary-General.\n\nThe ERC is supported by the CERF secretariat, which is situated within the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nThe CERF secretariat is responsible for ensuring that the funds are allocated properly, disbursed in a timely manner, and that use of the funds is reported appropriately and transparently.\n\nThe CERF Advisory Group provides policy guidance to the Secretary-General on the use and impact of the fund.",

We make progress toward this by reducing the reach of conflict, preventing the spread of pandemic disease, and counteracting the drivers of violence, instability, transnational crime and other security threats.

Children and young people are creative and have the skills to shape their lives and cope with adversity, even when they have experienced armed conflict. In War Child Netherlands’ projects, children and young people use creativity as a tool to cope with the effects of armed conflict. Creative activities generate positive energy, give children and young people new skills that they can be proud of and provide instant fun. They learn to overcome their fears, develop confidence, and find a way to deal with their experiences. Through active participation in our projects, children and young people, including the most vulnerable, are able to express their views freely and have a say in decision-making. As a conflict-sensitive organisation, War Child Netherlands ensures its actions and projects do not negatively influence a conflict.",

At national level, the national networks assume responsibility and ownership of their programme with technical support from the regional secretariat. WANEP principles emphasize ownership of peacebuilding practice. Given that the national networks understand their situation and realities , they are in a better position to engage their communities and government and intervene effectively. Our national networks facilitate a more bottom-up approach and allow their intervention to reflect the peculiarities of the issues of human security in their various countries.\n\nAt regional level, it is acknowledged that factors that fuel conflicts and their escalation in our sub-region are no respecters of artificially-imposed boundaries. Our regional programmes cut across national networks and are designed to increase leverage in engaging diverse actors at regional and international level. Overall, WANEP&#039;s strategy is to locate, empower, support and accompany local actors as they respond to conflicts within their communities.\n\nThese programs all functioning at the regional secretariat include:\n\nYouth and Peace Education (YPE); Capacity Building Program (CBP);\nCivil Society Coordination and Advocacy Program (CSPAP);\nJustice Lens Program (JLP);\nWomen in Peacebuilding (WIPNET);\nEarly Warning and Early Response (WARN);\nWest Africa Peacebuilding Institute (WAPI);\nResearch and Publications (RAP);\nMonitoring and Evaluation (M&R)",

    "description": " \n\nWOMEN’S ACTION GROUP PROFILE\n\n1.\tBackground\nWomen’s Action Group (WAG) was founded in 1983. It was the violation of the human rights of black women by a black government which gave birth to this organisation. WAG was formed following the arrest and incarceration of over 6 000 women from October to December 1983 under Operation Clean up and its purpose was to round up single women and charge them as prostitutes. Thousands of women were arrested and detained. It was the arbitrary arrest and denial of freedom for the women of Zimbabwe that saw a handful of ordinary women taking up the fight against injustice. Since then, WAG never looked back on advocating for women’s rights. The organisation was registered as an Educational Trust in 1987 and has gained consultative status with the United Nations’ Economic and Consultative Social Council (ECOSOC). \n1.1 Vision\nWAG’s vision is a Zimbabwe with empowered women and girls claiming and enjoying their rights in a situation of transformed power relations between women and men. The core purpose of the organisation is to champion women’s rights in Zimbabwe.\n1.2 Mission statement\nWAG’s mission statement is to develop products and tools for unlocking women’s power to claim and enjoy their rights in violence free and rights conscious communities.  The main programme areas for WAG include HIV & AIDS, Sexual reproductive health and rights and Gender based violence. \n1.3 Core purpose\n   WAG’s core purpose is to champion women’s rights in Zimbabwe.\n\n2.\tProgramme thematic areas\n2.1 HIV AND AIDS\nThe programme advocates for specific   HIV and AIDS policies that are sensitive to the needs of women and girls as well as empowering them to assert their rights to safer sex to prevent HIV infection   \nObjectives \n•\tTo raise awareness among communities particularly women and girls on  HIV and AIDS , gender and negative cultural practices increasing women’s vulnerability to HIV and AIDS\n•\tTo advocate for policies on HIV and AIDS, that are sensitive to the specific needs of women and that promote quality health service provision for women\n•\tTo empower women through information sharing to assert their right to safer sex to prevent HIV infection\n•\tTo actively participate in national, regional and international processes on HIV and AIDS and articulate the concerns of women, as part of the global response to HIV and AIDS\n\n2.2 GENDER BASED VIOLENCE\n\nThe programme touches on all aspects of women’s lives (public and private domain). The battle to free women from violence is fought on many angles including legislative reform, legal advice, counselling and representation and awareness raising campaigns. \nObjectives\n•\tTo increase national awareness on the negative impact of gender based violence on women and girls.\n•\tTo empower communities  particularly women to fight and prevent gender based violence in their lives\n•\tTo advocate for policies and laws that address gender inequalities and gender based violence\n•\tTo contribute to international, regional and national strategies and interventions to eradicate gender based violence\n2.3 SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RIGHTS  \nWAG is focusing on the Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights programme to promote strategies that respect the sexual and reproductive health rights and needs of women and girls.\nObjectives\n•\tTo promote gender equality in sexual and reproductive health and rights\n•\tTo lobby for access to quality health care services in Zimbabwe\n•\tTo raise community awareness and encourage them to come up initiatives and strategies that promote sexual and reproductive health and rights\n•\tTo contribute to national, regional and international strategies and interventions to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights\n2.4 AREAS OF OPERATION\nAll the three programmes operate at community and national level. WAG engages in awareness raising campaigns and training on addressing the intersections of HIV, gender based violence and women’s rights. WAG engages communities in dialogue on issues that affect them and come up with their own initiatives and solutions that promote the enjoyment of women’s rights. \nWAG also focuses on lobbying and advocacy for gender sensitive laws and policies. The organisations also works closely with the policy makers (the women’s caucus, parliamentary portfolio on health) to ensure that they commit to the international and regional instruments on women’s rights that Zimbabwe has ratified.\n\n3.\tTechnical expertise\nWomen’s Action Group has experience in the field of gender equality and gender-based violence programming having worked in 26 Districts under the Integrated Support Programme (ISP) on prevention of GBV. Under the same programme, WAG demonstrated its expertise in capacity building through training of Behaviour Change Facilitators (BCFs) on integrating GBV in HIV programming in 13 Districts. WAG also made an input into the GBV training manual that was developed for BCFs. WAG has also demonstrated its training expertise through multi-sectoral training in 26 ISP Districts that resulted in the development of District level referral pathways for the 26 Districts. WAG has also developed training material for other programmes on gender equality such as the training manual for Community Based Advocates under the UN Women H4+ programme and has also developed GBV training manuals for training of service providers, civil society organisations and Community Based Advocates under the Amplify Change programme. WAG also has dedicated staff who have technical expertise in gender equality programming. Of particular interest has been WAG’s contribution to national priorities and its commitment to preventing GBV as one of its key strategic objectives under the current and past organisation strategic frameworks.\nOne of WAG’s flagship that has been championed over the years has been the production of booklets and the Speak Out magazine which requires fluency in both English and Shona as well as writing and editorial expertise. Through the production of other materials such as training manuals, WAG has also improved their ability to write concisely and produce material that has been shared globally through the website and other media channels. \nOther key competencies \nWAG believes that with teamwork the organisation can achieve greater results as individuals have diverse expertise. WAG also has respect for diversity having worked with diverse groups of people across ethnic backgrounds and lifestyles. The current programmes on gender equality requires WAG to have the aptitude to fit in different societies with different cultures and religions such as the Tonga people, apostolic sects, sex workers and persons with disabilities while maintaining respect of their differences.  WAG also values communication as a key component in coordinating programmes and have reputable communication structures with its partners. WAG has a good track record in delivering programme objectives and this has been demonstrated through its commitment to achieving results in all programmes undertaken. \n \n4.\tStaff Skills\nSpeciality Area\tPublic Health Expert and RH and Gender Specialist (Director)\tGBV Officer  Expert\tM and E Officer\nExperience in Public Health in Zimbabwe\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nCommunication  skills   \n\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nAppreciation of  SRHR \t√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nKnowledge of GBV \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nKnowledge  of HIV & AIDS\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nTraining skills \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nDevelopment of manuals  \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nAbility to research, analyse, evaluate, synthesize and present information \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nWriting skills \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\nFacilitating meetings and innovative/effective methodologies\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\n\n\n\n",

As the national umbrella body of 17 regional legal aid offices (LBH) across 17 different provinces, YLBHI assists its locally established offices in case advocacy, policy advocacy, and community empowerment to guard the spirit of rule of law, democracy and human rights in Indonesia. The organization has a strong history in Indonesia, playing a key role in strengthening civil society, democracy, and human rights. During the Soeharto regime, YLBHI-LBH became one of the key actors in opposing and overthrowing the regime, acting as a node and locomotive for the pro-democracy movement in Indonesia. YLBHI consistently fights for democracy and human rights and has birthed civil society organizations that currently play an important role in protecting the human rights of marginalized peoples and communities.",

    "description": "Young Africa offers skills training in various technical, commercial and agricultural skills. Click here for a list of all our Training Courses. The nature of courses on offer is based on market demand and through on-going evaluation with our target group of young people aged 15-25. Course content is made up of over 70% practical training and 30% trade-related theory training. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is integrated with Life Skills and Entrepreneurship education. Where available, our courses are linked to government vocational training systems, or accredited by relevant local authorities. Each semester, students who pass their exams receive their certificates at festive graduation ceremonies. Our integrated TVET has evolved over the years and is now being delivered in three different models: centre-based, mobile outreach and industry-attached.\nAt our six centres, young people participate in the integrated TVET training programme for periods ranging from 8 weeks to 12 months depending on the course and level. The 70% practical exposure is made possible by our unique Franchise Model whereby all courses are franchised to local entrepreneurs who pay rent for the use of YA facilities, equipment and brand name, while also training our students on-the-job. The curriculum is defined, and the quality of education controlled, by Young Africa staff. Life Skills education and Entrepreneurship training form a part of the curriculum.\nIn response to the growing demand for TVET and employability programmes among disadvantaged young people in marginalised, remote and outlying areas, YA Zimbabwe has been implementing an outreach TVET programme where a mobile unit comprising equipment, trainers and training consumables moves from one remote site to the other delivering 12 week-long TVET programmes, fully integrated with entrepreneurship development and Life Skills education. After training, students undertake an attachment and, where necessary, YA offers post-training support such as linking graduates with micro-financing institution.\nIndustry-attached training\nThis new approach to delivering TVET was piloted by Young Africa Namibia in 2015 as a way to influence channelling of corporate social responsibility resources towards job-related skills training. Young Africa joins forces with leading local industries with interest in offering job-related skills training at their industrial sites. Through this model, small groups of up to six unemployed young people receive practical job-related skills training over a certain number of days per week at the industrial site for period of up to three months. During the three-month period, Young Africa joins in to offer Life Skills education and Entrepreneurship skills training to this group of students. Trainees do not pay for their training. All training costs are borne by the training company. The company pays Young Africa a fee for conducting Life Skills and Entrepreneurship training.\nWant to know more about our unique method?\nYA HUB offers various training packages in youth work, life skills education, entrepreneurship, organisation sustainability and more. Training can be facilitated in-house, at the Young Africa HUB in Harare, Zimbabwe, or at your specific location. Browse the list of YA HUB Services here.",
