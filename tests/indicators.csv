Decrees are included if they meet the same standards. In addition, the FOIA must be in use for at least the executive part of the government; therefore, FOIAs which are only adopted, approved or still in draft form are not counted. For multilateral donors, international finance institutions (IFIs) and private foundations, a disclosure or transparency policy is accepted as equivalent to a FOIA.

accessibility,Accessibility,commitment,,,"The overall accessibility of aid information through the organisations' portals, project databases or searchable data sources. These are scored using three criteria: 1) the portal allows free, bulk export of data; 2) it contains detailed disaggregated data; 3) the data is published under an open licence. If a portal allows bulk export through its API but not through its web-user interface, this is accepted as allowing free, bulk export of data. Data sources are the organisations' own aid portals, publicly accessible databases or websites - accessed in that order. The portal or database must include information on current activities for the countries or sectors the organisation is working in rather than just one individual country/sector. It should contain information on at least five of the activity-level indicators, at least one of which should cover financial information. The same data source is used for all three checks. For example, if the aid portal does not state that the data is published under an open licence, this will not be checked elsewhere on the organisation's project database or website. If the organisation's website is the data source then it cannot score on the ""free bulk export"" criterion. If a portal allows bulk export through its API but not through its web-user interface, this is accepted as allowing free, bulk export of data.

In many cases, total budgets are established annually, once total financial figures of all investments are taken into account.

The figure could be indicative. Scores are awarded on the basis of the number of years (up to three years) for which organisations are publishing budget information. Each year ahead is worth 33.33 points out of a total possible score of 100. Aggregate budgets of between 2-3 years will be scored the same as 1 year forward budgets. Both country budgets or thematic budgets are accepted for organisations that prioritise their work by countries. Projected figures disaggregated along thematic and sectoral priorities, at a near similar level of detail to total organisation budgets are accepted. IFIs and DFIs sometimes publish ""road maps"" which contain this information. The start and end date for forward budgets are calculated based on organisations' fiscal years for information collected via the survey. Budgets need to run up to a minimum of December 2016 to score for 'three years forward'. Organisations at the end of their fixed budget cycles and therefore without a published budget for the next three years do not receive points for this indicator.
