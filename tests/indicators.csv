Data sources can be the organisations’ own aid portals, publicly accessible databases or websites – accessed in that order. The portal or database must include information on current activities for the countries or sectors the organisation is working in rather than just one individual country/sector or a selected group. It should contain information on at least five of the activity-level indicators, at least one of which should cover financial information. The same data source is used for all three checks. For example, if the aid portal does not state that the data is published under an open licence, this is not checked elsewhere on the organisation’s project database or website. If the organisation’s website is the data source then it cannot score on the “free bulk export” criterion.

If a portal allows bulk export through its API but not through its web-user interface, this is accepted as allowing free, bulk export of data.

A country strategy paper sets out the organisation’s planned approach and activities in the recipient country. For it to be accepted it needs to be a detailed document, rather than just a paragraph on the organisation’s website.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Country strategy paper (document code = B03). A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is a document that details the agreement usually between the organisation and recipient government for the provision of aid in the country.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Memorandum of Understanding (document code = B13 or A09).

For organisations such as IFIs, philanthropic organisations and vertical funds, which may not have country-level strategies, mid-level documents between organisation and activity-level are accepted, e.g. thematic or sectoral-level documents.

If the organisation follows the strategy of a parent or related organisation, a statement clarifying this is needed on the website along with a link to the relevant strategy document. Similarly, if the organisation supports a country-led or developed strategy, this must be explicitly stated on the website and the link to the relevant strategy document needs to be provided.

Some organisations do not sign MoUs, so jointly developed documents governing the relationship between the organisation and the recipient are accepted as equivalent, e.g. investment codes or partnership/country agreements that have been developed in conjunction with recipient governments, agreements with implementing partners or with grantees.

Several publishers report IATI transactions to countries that do not have a specific country strategy or MoU and including one is not reflective of the geographic focus of the entity. This test will exclude these countries from the country strategy document test, testing only for relevant countries. 

We will determine the relevant recipient countries for by checking an official source (such as an annual report or organisation data portal) to confirm the list of countries in which the organisation worked and directly implemented projects within the last year. This is used as the denominator when calculating the score. Ahead of each Index Publish What You Fund will survey publishers for their baseline countries along with those countries which they deem suitable for exclusion, and why. This list will be compared to an official source. Exclusions of countries from the baseline will be allowed if they are on the ‘Allowed exclusions’ list. 

The IATI organisation file is then consulted for the full list of country strategy or MoU documents and checked against the total list of countries. Points are awarded for the proportion of recipient countries that have an associated country strategy or MoU. 

Allowed exclusions:

• Funding is diverted to a country for administrative purposes only 
• Where a country falls into the bottom 10% of recipient countries by volume of aid channelled by the assessed organisation. 
• Investments to a specific country are part of a co-financing venture only 
• The country is not being targeted directly (I.E through multilateral funding or regional funding)

project-budget,Project budget,publication,activity,Finance and budgets,"The budget of the activity is the breakdown of the total financial commitment to the activity into forwardlooking annual and quarterly chunks.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Budget or Planned Disbursement.

For organisations where this may be deemed as commercially sensitive information, total estimated cost of fund/grant/loan amount is accepted or sections within a document can be redacted. The specific reasons for the redactions need to be explicitly stated in detail and must clarify why the information is commercially sensitive and would cause material and direct harm if published.

This indicator is more rigorously measured for IATI publishers (information published to IATI is scored higher than information published in other formats). Providing an annual forward budget allows an IATI publisher to score up to half the total available data quality points, while providing a quarterly forward-looking budget enables them to score the remaining half. This change has been made in recognition of recipient countries needing to be able to map activities to their own financial year rather than the calendar year.

Note: The difference between indicators 11 and 12 is that indicator 11 requires the overall activity budget to be broken down by individual line items for the activity. To score on indicator 12, the funds allocated to the activity must be broken down by year and quarter for at least the next year ahead. Spending by individual line items is not required. For the manual survey, if the required information for both indicators 11 and 12 is available in a single document, it can be considered for both indicators.",11,0,1./30,,,1

While such information might be considered to be commercially sensitive by some organisations, Publish What You Fund’s view is that actual expenditure information is less sensitive once the money has been spent. Hence all organisations are scored on this indicator. For IFIs and DFIs, the total fund/loan amount spent is accepted and details of the loan repayment costs and related charges can be redacted.

budget-alignment,Budget Alignment,publication,activity,Finance and budgets,"The budget classification is a way of linking the activity to the recipient country government’s own budget codes. There are two parts to this indicator.

The first part captures the percentage of the total commitment allocated to or planned for capital expenditure. When publishing in IATI, a number between 0 and 100 should be used, with no percentage sign.

The definition of capital expenditure follows the IMF GFS definition approved by WP Stat in February 2016.

Capital spending is generally defined as physical assets with a useful life of more than one year. But it also includes capital improvements or the rehabilitation of physical assets that enhance or extend the useful life of the asset (as distinct from repair or maintenance, which assures that the asset is functional for its planned life). Capital includes all aspects of design and construction that are required to make the asset operational.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: capital spend.

The second part checks that the activity is not using broad “multisector aid” or “sector not specified” sector codes. It checks that the activity is using one of the detailed “voluntary” CRS purpose codes and not aggregated “parent” codes. 

Further detail about this indicator and details of the relevant codes can be found in the IATI guidance on country budget alignment.

Differentiating between expenditure on consumption or investment in capital is of critical importance for recipient country governments in macroeconomic management and in short- and long-term growth strategy.  Capital spend can be reported as 0 for those projects that do not include any capital expenditure.

This test encourages use of codes that can be used to map against recipient country budgets. If organisations want to make their aid data useful to partner countries in their budget processes, they should not use very broad codes that make it hard to understand the nature of a particular project and therefore where it should be placed in the budget.

IFIs and DFIs tend only to publish impact appraisals if regulations require them to, but given the link they have to the eventual impact and results of the activity, all organisations are scored on this indicator.

For loans or private sector investment, risk assessments and the fiscal objectives detailed in the loan document are accepted. These need to be sufficiently detailed and include any criteria used to assess eligibility for receiving the loan. For DFI projects categorised as high-risk (environmental or social risk category A or equivalent) the full impact appraisal document(s) should be published. A summary of the appraisal will not be sufficient.

Humanitarian Implementation Plans (HIPs) and project plans are accepted for humanitarian agencies.

If an official internal procedure has concluded that a pre-project impact appraisal is not necessary for a particular project or programme, official documentation confirming this will be accepted in lieu of an appraisal document.",33,0,0.05,1,,

This can include whether the intended objectives were met, what the major factors influencing the achievement or nonachievement of the objectives were and an assessment of the impact, effect and value of the activity. This information may be on a specific evaluation section of the organisation’s website.

If the activity under assessment is not completed but evaluation or review documents are available for other completed activities, these will be accepted.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Review of project performance and evaluation (document code = A07).

This information often refers to log frames and results chains and may be within a specific results or evaluation section of the organisation’s website.

The IATI references for this indicator are: Result and/or Results, outcomes and outputs (Document code = A08).

Both current and completed activities are considered for this indicator. If the activity has started recently (within the last 18 months), then no actual results are expected. If the activity is ongoing then up to date results should be available. If the activity has ended then the actual results should be available within 12-months of ending.",35,0,0.05,,,
