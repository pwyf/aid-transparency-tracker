foia,Quality of FOI legislation,commitment,,Organisational planning and commitments,"The definition used in the Global RTI Rating is that it has to be a law in the strict sense. It must include the right of access to information, this right has to be enforceable and there must be compliant, court and high court appeal possibilities. Decrees are included if they meet the same standards. In addition, the FOIA must be in use for at least the executive part of the government; therefore, FOIAs which are only adopted, approved or still in draft form are not counted.

For multilateral donors, international finance institutions (IFIs) and private foundations, a disclosure or transparency policy is accepted as equivalent to a FOIA.

accessibility,Accessibility,commitment,,Organisational planning and commitments,"The overall accessibility of aid information through the organisations’ portals, project databases or searchable data sources. These are scored using three criteria: 1) the portal allows free, bulk export of data; 2) it contains detailed disaggregated data; 3) the data is published under an open licence.

Data sources can be the organisations’ own aid portals, publicly accessible databases or websites – accessed in that order. The portal or database must include information on current activities for the countries or sectors the organisation is working in rather than just one individual country/sector or a selected group. It should contain information on at least five of the activity-level indicators, at least one of which should cover financial information. The same data source is used for all three checks. For example, if the aid portal does not state that the data is published under an open licence, this is not checked elsewhere on the organisation’s project database or website. If the organisation’s website is the data source then it cannot score on the “free bulk export” criterion.

If a portal allows bulk export through its API but not through its web-user interface, this is accepted as allowing free, bulk export of data.

Note that raw IATI files are not accepted for this indicator as the underlying principle behind it is to assess what organisations are doing to promote access and use of their aid information.

A country or sector strategy will be accepted. Where one cannot be found, an MoU signed by the donor organisation and recipient country government will be accepted.

A country strategy paper sets out the organisation’s planned approach and activities in the recipient country. For it to be accepted it needs to be a detailed document, rather than just a paragraph on the organisation’s website.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Country strategy paper (document code = B03). A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is a document that details the agreement usually between the organisation and recipient government for the provision of aid in the country.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Memorandum of Understanding (document code = B13 or A09).

For organisations such as IFIs, philanthropic organisations and vertical funds, which may not have country-level strategies, mid-level documents between organisation and activity-level are accepted, e.g. thematic or sectoral-level documents.

If the organisation follows the strategy of a parent or related organisation, a statement clarifying this is needed on the website along with a link to the relevant strategy document. Similarly, if the organisation supports a country-led or developed strategy, this must be explicitly stated on the website and the link to the relevant strategy document needs to be provided.

Some organisations do not sign MoUs, so jointly developed documents governing the relationship between the organisation and the recipient are accepted as equivalent, e.g. investment codes or partnership/country agreements that have been developed in conjunction with recipient governments, agreements with implementing partners or with grantees.",7,0,0.01875,1,,

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Annual forward planning budget (total-budget)

IFIs and DFIs do not have budgets allocated to them as traditional donor agencies do. In many cases, total budgets are established annually, once total financial figures of all investments are taken into account.

Aggregate budgets of between 2–3 years are scored the same as 1-year forward budgets.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Annual forward planning budgets for recipient countries (recipient-country-budget).

Both country budgets and thematic budgets are accepted for organisations that prioritise their work by countries. Projected figures disaggregated along thematic and sectoral priorities, at a near similar level of detail to total organisation budgets are accepted. IFIs and DFIs sometimes publish “road maps”, which contain this information.

For information collected via the manual survey, the start and end date for forward budgets are calculated based on each organisation’s fiscal year. Organisations at the end of their fixed budget cycles who do not have a published budget for the next three years do not receive points for this indicator.

Forward Spending Survey data reported to the OECD DAC is taken into account only if it is available for the specific organisation under assessment.",10,1,1./24,,,
project-budget-document,Project budget document,publication,activity,Finance and budgets,"This is a specific budget detailing what the intended spending is for the different lines of the individual activity. It is often a document published on the organisation’s website.

Budget documents cannot simply be at the country level. If an activity budget is included in a larger country-level document, it is only accepted if the budget for the activity is broken down line by line.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Budget (document code = A05).

For organisations where budget documents might be considered commercially sensitive, documents with redactions of the commercially sensitive pieces of information are accepted.

project-budget,Project budget,publication,activity,Finance and budgets,"The budget of the activity is the breakdown of the total financial commitment to the activity into forwardlooking annual and quarterly chunks.

The IATI reference for this indicator is: Budget or Planned Disbursement.

For organisations where this may be deemed as commercially sensitive information, total estimated cost of fund/grant/loan amount is accepted or sections within a document can be redacted. The specific reasons for the redactions need to be explicitly stated in detail and must clarify why the information is commercially sensitive and would cause material and direct harm if published.

This indicator is more rigorously measured for IATI publishers (information published to IATI is scored higher than information published in other formats). Providing an annual forward budget allows an IATI publisher to score up to half the total available data quality points, while providing a quarterly forward-looking budget enables them to score the remaining half. This change has been made in recognition of recipient countries needing to be able to map activities to their own financial year rather than the calendar year.

Note: The difference between indicators 11 and 12 is that indicator 11 requires the overall activity budget to be broken down by individual line items for the activity. To score on indicator 12, the funds allocated to the activity must be broken down by year and quarter for at least the next year ahead. Spending by individual line items is not required. For the manual survey, if the required information for both indicators 11 and 12 is available in a single document, it can be considered for both indicators.",11,0,1./30,,,

While such information might be considered to be commercially sensitive by some organisations, Publish What You Fund’s view is that actual expenditure information is less sensitive once the money has been spent. Hence all organisations are scored on this indicator. For IFIs and DFIs, the total fund/loan amount spent is accepted and details of the loan repayment costs and related charges can be redacted.
